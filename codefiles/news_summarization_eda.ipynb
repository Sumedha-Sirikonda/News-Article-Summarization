DAVID BIANCULLI DAILY NEWS TV CRITIC\n\nThursday, May 13th 2004, 7:20AM\n\nIt's a jarring, but instructive, coincidence: The same week Warner Home Video releases a DVD set with all the original season's episodes of \"The Jetsons,\" Cartoon Network revisits George and his Space Age family in a less-than-futuristic episode of \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.\"\n\nThe \"Back to the Present\" episode of \"Harvey Birdman,\" premiering Sunday night at 11, is a riot. The 24-episode DVD set of \"The Jetsons,\" (four disks, $64.92), is a minor revelation.\n\nAfter William Hanna and Joseph Barbera struck prime-time gold in 1960 with \"The Flintstones,\" which translated \"The Honeymooners\" into prehistoric animation, they tried again with \"The Jetsons.\"\n\nThe show imagined a future world - set in far-off 2002 - where meals were cooked by pushing a button, sidewalks moved while people stood still, TV was projected on giant screens, and people were whisked from one location to another via pneumatic glass tubes.\n\nOkay, so they were wrong about the tubes.\n\nBut unlike \"The Simpsons,\" an animated prime-time series that remains far and away the best-selling title on DVD, the old \"Jetsons\" episodes don't reward repeated viewings. They punish them.\n\nA more rewarding venture is \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.\" Three years ago, Hanna-Barbera optioned the rights to the characters in \"Birdman\" - a very mature cartoon built around a character from a very immature Hanna-Barbera series.\n\nA little history may help: In 1967, a few years after launching \"Jetsons\" in prime time on ABC (where it lasted one season), Hanna-Barbera presented a vapid Saturday-morning series on NBC. It was called \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio,\" and featured winged heroes trying to save the world.\n\nBirdman was a B-level hero even by Hanna-Barbera standards, so \"Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law\" creators Michael Ouweleen and Erik Richter had no problem reimagining him as a suit-wearing, wing-sporting defense attorney, taking on cases brought to him by various characters in the Hanna-Barbera universe.\n\nThe best of these, from early in the run, reimagined Fred Flintstone as a mob boss, complete with an opening sequence that married those from \"The Flintstones\" and \"The Sopranos.\" (Its title: \"Dabba-Dabba-Don.\")\n\nFor Sunday's \"Harvey Birdman,\" Harvey is visited by the Jetsons, who travel to Harvey's time period to sue everyone for ruining the planet.\n\n\"We're from the future,\" George explains. \"The magnificent, far-off year of 2002.\"\n\nWell, that is the 21st century, and George doesn't quite get - but audiences will - how the imagined future of \"The Jetsons\" at times hasn't even kept pace with our own reality.\n\nGeorge provides Harvey, for example, with a giant stack of evidence he claims will support his lawsuit.\n\n\"Punch cards,\" he explains helpfully, taking a condescending tone. \"In the future, that's how we input data into machines we call computers.\"\n\nThat's what I call funny.\n\nAnd that's just what I don't call the original \"Jetsons.\" For now, save your money on the DVD set. Maybe it'll be on sale, in the discount bins, in the very near future.","Scarlett Johansson says Dylan Farrow was \"irresponsible\" in naming her in an open letter that slammed the film industry for its silence over claims she was sexually abused by Woody Allen.\n\nThe Hollywood actress criticized Allen's estranged adoptive daughter, who is now 28, for implicating her and a host of other A-list actors in a case she said they \"know nothing about.\"\n\nIn Farrow's note, published in The New York Times last month, she accused the director of abusing her when she was 7 years old.\n\nShe also condemned the entire film industry for what she claimed was its silence on the matter.\n\nBut Johansson, who's starred in three of Allen's movies, told The Guardian it was \"irresponsible\" of Farrow to name and shame actors who know nothing about the case.\n\n\"I think it's irresponsible to take a bunch of actors that will have a Google alert on and to suddenly throw their name into a situation none of us could possibly knowingly comment on.\"\n\n\"That just feels irresponsible to me,\" she added.\n\nAsked whether her opinion of Allen, 78, had changed since the emergence of the allegations, the 29-year-old actress said: \"I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"It would be ridiculous for me to make any kind of assumption one way or the other,\" she added.\n\nAnd, when questioned whether there had been a backlash against Allen, who directed her in \"Scoop,\" \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\" and \"Match Point,\" she replied: \"I'm unaware that's there's been a backlash.\"\n\n\"I think he'll continue to know what he knows about the situation, and I'm sure the other people involved have their own experience with it.\"\n\n\"It's not like this is somebody that's been prosecuted and found guilty of something, and you can then go, 'I don't support this lifestyle or whatever.' I mean, it's all guesswork,\" she told the British newspaper.\n\nFarrow's letter to The New York Times said that: \"(W)hen I was 7 years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house.\"\n\n\"He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me,\" she added.\n\nAllen has denied the allegations, with his lawyer Elkan Abramowitz claiming that they are the result of \"implanted\" memories and not actual reality.\n\n\"She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia Farrow years ago, and the idea that she was molested was implanted in her by her mother. And that memory is never going to go away,\" he told The Today show.","FORTUNE — The NPD Group’s Stephen Baker chose Tuesday 9/11 — the day before the expected launch of Apple’s AAPL new iPhone — to pour cold water on what he calls the “growing expectation that this release will achieve the equivalent blowout sales success that the iPhone 4s enjoyed.”\n\nEquivalent? As we reported Monday, conventional wisdom on Wall Street has it that the iPhone 5 will outsell the iPhone 4S by a wide margin.\n\nAmong the handful of analysts who were willing to venture a guess, estimates for iPhone 5 sales this quarter (i.e. in the eight days from 9/21 and 9/29) ranged from 6 to 12 million. It took Apple three days to sell 4 million iPhone 4S units last year. Topeka’s Brian White estimates by day 3, the company will have sold 5 to 5.5 million iPhone 5s.\n\nStephen Baker begs to differ.\n\n“The iPhone 5,” he writes, “will launch into a U.S. smartphone market with very different dynamics than the launch window of the iPhone 4 or the iPhone 4s. And these dynamics have nothing to do with the strength of the new product offering, its hardware configuration, its marketing, or even its competition. The U.S. smartphone market appears to be an increasingly mature one. A recent press release from NPD detailed that total growth in the US market was just 9 percent in the second quarter (Q2), and all that growth was the result of the increased prevalence of pre-paid devices in the market…\n\n“As the market matures the challenges of growing faster than the industry multiplies. Blowing away all weakened competition, as Apple has done to this point, makes it infinitely harder to continue to blow away the remainder, because they are, by virtue of their current position, much more competitive than those that have fallen by the wayside.”\n\nBaker may be right. But it’s also true that the NPD group measures only U.S. retail sales, while Apple sells all over the world. In fact, of the 37 million iPhones it sold in the December quarter last year — the first that included the iPhone 4S — nearly half (17 million) were purchased outside the U.S.\n\nAll this suggests that the number to watch for at Apple’s special event tomorrow is how many countries will be getting the new phone on Day 1. Last year, the iPhone 4S launched initially in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the U.K..","The Mobil Oil Corporation has made its mark in the advertising world as a tough media street fighter that has pioneered an aggressive style of advertising in explaining oil industry profits, pricing and policy decisions.\n\nPublic relations experts have generally given Mobil high marks for its techniques. But yesterday, many said Mobil might have overplayed its aggressiveness and embarrassed itself with a series of price reversals this week in response to new state taxes on oil companies.\n\n''It looked like they were out to gouge the public,'' said an executive vice president at one of the largest public relations firms in New York. ''It was a serious public relations mistake. They ended up going through a lot of grief they didn't have to.''\n\nHerbert Schmertz, a Mobil vice president and director of its public relations, declined to answer questions yesterday about Mobil's response to the tax legislation.\n\nFrom the moment the New York State Assembly began to consider a package of five taxes designed to aid mass transit, Mobil was in the forefront of opposition, buttonholing legislators and taking out $80,000 worth of ads in 14 state newspapers. Tax Bill Signed Sunday\n\nThis effort, however, failed last Sunday when the package, which included a three-quarters of 1 percent tax on oil company gross receipts and a new formula to calculate oil company franchise taxes, was signed into law.\n\nBut the biggest setback came this week, when Mobil announced a 3-cent-a-gallon rise in the price of its gasoline. While other companies hung back, saying they were studying the situation, Mobil defended the increase, drawing denunciations from Mayor Koch and pickets at Mobil stations.\n\nIn response, Mobil replied that it had considered raising prices even more, but that market conditions would not permit it. This tough talk was followed by more conciliatory words by the end of the week. On closer scrunity, Mobil said, it now agreed with state officials who had contended that Mobil had misunderstood such key provisions of the legislation as its starting date and the fact that much of the tax fell on retail dealers, not on Mobil. Now, Mobil said, the price increase would only be 1.3 cents a gallon. Company spokesmen, however, told reporters that Mobil was still unable to explain the arithmetic used to reach this conclusion. 'Wanted to Make a Point'\n\n''I don't think they intended to handle it more smoothly,'' said Lloyd N. Newman, an executive vice president with the public relations firm of Manning, Selvage & Lee and former president of the New York Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America.\n\n''I think they wanted to make a dramatic point. They have a confrontational style. I personally would not have handled it that way. I try to concilate things. A lot could have been done behind the scenes, but they didn't choose to do so. That's consistent with their approach,'' he said.\n\n''You don't test the waters with trial balloons and then reverse your position,'' said Howard J. Rubenstein, president of Howard J. Rubenstein Associates. ''That destroys your credibility. It is very important to explain all the factors that go into an increase. And you'd better think that out, so it is not an apparent raw grasp for money.'' There Are Some Admirers\n\nDespite this, some public relations experts said yesterday that Mobil's stance had been effective in shaping public opinion more favorably toward the oil companies and had encouraged other oil companies to adopt more forceful advertising campaigns.\n\nMobil maintains a $21 million budget for all advertising, from sponsorship of public television programs to lobbying legislators. ''I'm an admirer of Mobil as a whole,'' said Graham H. Phillips, managing director of Olgilvy & Mather. ''They've taken a courageous stance on key issues facing us, and as far as I know they've been effective. Before Mobil's public issue campaign, oil companies took a lot of grief from the press. Our research into the attitudes towards the company shows they've had some success with the managerial segment that reads their ads.''\n\nBut, Mr. Phillips said, Mobil's high visiblity brings high risk. ''There is danger with an advocacy campaign that you would create more negatives with positives.''\n\nIndeed, at least once during Mobil's antitax campaign, the company's visibility drew attention to its opposition and gave it a large public forum. A Shouting Match\n\nThe incident occurred last Tuesday, when the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit organization, gave a news conference near Mobil headquarters in New York to criticize the increase. When the speaker called for questions from the audience, one voice raised was that of Mr. Schmertz. Soon, a shouting match ensued between the speakers and the Mobil vice president.\n\nThe result was that the confrontation received wide news coverage, and the research group, according to Gene M. Russianoff, a staff attorney who was the speaker at the session, got more publicity than if the company had remained silent.\n\n''You had a colorful case of a Mobil Corporation vice president coming down to scream at demonstrators,'' Mr. Russianoff said. ''We got two-minute spots on CBS radio, and I don't think we would have gotten that much coverage alone.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Herbert Schmertz","Mid-month stats show it's been the 4th warmest start to December on record with temps 3.2 °C above average pic.twitter.com/S8UofgF7zZ\n\nAnd then I had a ghastly vision. What if this is it? What if this is the long-awaited inflexion point – the moment that has been prophesied since the Eighties? What if winter is over – for ever?\n\nAaargh, I thought: and in that moment of horror, I contemplated the loss of something so intrinsic to our psychology. Imagine: no more snow. No more tobogganing on Primrose Hill, no more waking up to see the magic prints of the dog on the lawn.\n\nImagine if this unseasonably warm spell is just the beginning of a long period of meteorological mediocrity: no more ice on the canal, no lovely crispness in the air, no excuse to walk into a room with a fire and go “brrr” while theatrically rubbing your hands.\n\n\"In my despair, I rang the great physicist and meteorologist Piers Corbyn. You know, Jeremy's brother\"\n\nImagine if we have nothing in these long, dark months save a muggy and melancholy mildness, soft, damp and unwholesome; nothing but rain and a louring grey sky pressing down on our hungover eyeballs. The thought made me feel almost unwell.\n\nIn my despair, I rang the great physicist and meteorologist Piers Corbyn. You know Piers: he is the older brother of Jezza, and he is famous for believing that the world – on the whole – is getting colder, and that the whole global warming theory is unsound, to say the least. Piers thinks that whatever the role of humanity in affecting the temperature of the planet, that role is pitifully trivial next to the Sun, the supercolossal boiling ball of gas about which we revolve and which enables life on Earth.\n\nIn the view of Piers and his colleagues at WeatherAction, it is all about sun spots, and he is on record as believing that we are now due for a new “Maunder Minimum” – like the famous cold spell in the 17th century, when the Thames froze several times.\n\n#Wild-#JetStream Mini-#IceAge conditions here to stay 20yrs says #Piers #Corbyn https://t.co/ZLiJscAl5u #NotCO2 RT https://t.co/QdTT8FJZRO\n\n“Piers,” I said – and I felt like the children of Israel, denouncing Jeremiah for getting it wrong – “what about the new Ice Age? Where is it?”\n\nAnd Piers did his best to calm me down. “Helmsman!” he said (since that is how he addresses me). “Relax. Winter has not gone.” And he went on to argue, quite persuasively, that there are plenty of places that are really very cold at the moment – the west of the USA, for instance. He reminded me of the prodigious snows that hit the eastern seaboard of America last winter. Yes, it is warm in the UK at the moment – amazingly warm – but the UK and its territorial waters amount to only one six-hundredth of the planet.\n\nThe current mild spell would last till the end of January, he said, and it would then turn bitterly cold in February. Whatever is happening to the weather at the moment, he said, it is nothing to do with the conventional doctrine of climate change.\n\nLondon policemen on ice skates on the frozen River Thames circa 1900 Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnd there, of course, he is in agreement with the vast majority of mainstream science. Meteorologists of all kinds – climate change sceptics and believers – can see the difference between climate and weather; between randomly occurring changes and deep, long-term trends.\n\nWe ordinary human beings are not so rational; we are no different from all earlier cultures in that we have to put ourselves in the story, and to attribute this or that individual weather event to our own behaviour or moral failures. Think of Agamemnon at Aulis, unable to get the wind he needed to sail for Troy. What was the problem? He had shot a deer sacred to Artemis. And the solution? Sacrifice his daughter! It was all about him, him, him.\n\nScientists look at the data. But everyone else just looks at the weather – and it is the weather, therefore, that makes the psychological difference to the debate. Look at the recent summit in Paris, which ended in a good agreement to cut CO2, in contrast to the debacle at Copenhagen six years ago. What was the real difference? It was the weather. Paris was ridiculously warm for December. Six years ago, Copenhagen saw the biggest snowfalls anyone could remember. “Global warming?” everyone asked.\n\nIt is fantastic news that the world has agreed to cut pollution and help people save money, but I am sure that those global leaders were driven by a primitive fear that the present ambient warm weather is somehow caused by humanity; and that fear – as far as I understand the science – is equally without foundation.\n\nThere may be all kinds of reasons why I was sweating at ping-pong – but they don’t include global warming.","NEW YORK— Sears. RCA. Gulf and Western. National Steel. Baldwin United. Greyhound. General Electric. Control Data. Not to mention American Express, Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Beneficial and Transamerica.\n\nThese are the bankers of today. And the list goes on. Need a loan? Want to make a deposit? Get a line of credit? Sign up for a credit card, an auto loan, a second mortgage, a first mortgage? Americans no longer need banks to satisfy their financial needs. Nor are the banks themselves ''just banks'' any more. They are, or are trying to be, go-go financial marketers. They prefer to call themselves ''financial services companies,'' just like the American Expresses and the Merrill Lynches.\n\nThe banks are even finding ways around federal laws that prohibit them from engaging in certain activities or branching across state lines. Despite the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which bars commercial banks from many investment banking activities, the BankAmerica Corp. recently announced that it planned to buy Charles Schwab & Co., one of the nation's largest discount brokerage firms.\n\nThe very definition of what banking or financial services entail expands almost daily. Many financiers would include real estate brokerage, executive relocation and sophisticated communications networks as part of their ''financial services'' package.\n\nBanks are busy sending up communications satellites and building earth stations to receive signals from outer space. And a number of the nonfinancial companies that are expanding their financial businesses, such as the International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., happen also to be in communications.\n\nThe reason: Financial services is, most basically, the movement of money, and the movement depends on high-technology communications. Thus, American Express spent about $250 million this year to operate and expand its computer operations. And it is spending another $35 million to build an earth station in Salt Lake City that will enable it to approve transactions within seconds anywhere in the world.\n\nSuch expenses, plus the growing competition from new entries into the field, have been prompting mergers of once fiercely independent concerns. The Bache Group has been swallowed by the Prudential Insurance Co. Shearson Loeb Rhoades is part of American Express. Dean Witter Reynolds is becoming part of Sears. Salomon Brothers was merged into the Phibro Corp., a large commodities-trading company, and Dillon Read was acquired by the Bechtel family, owner of the world-renowned engineering firm.\n\nDoes it make sense and where will it end? To companies already in some aspects of the financial business, it seems that the only way to compete is to offer a full range of services - to become a financial department store. To those who are not yet in it, providing financial services appears to have a lot of obvious pluses:\n\n- To industrial companies that have been trying to keep up with costly pollution regulations, finance seems exquisitely clean. - To companies in heavy industry that need to spend billions of dollars to ''reindustrialize'' out-of-date plants, entry into the financial business seems cheap.\n\n- To corporations that have been hurt by high labor costs, financial services seems not to be labor-intensive. - To industries that have been badly hurt by competition from foreign imports, finance seems impervious to inroads from abroad. But the rush may well be risky, as those with more experience in the field have found. Like many other industries, the financial services business tends to be cyclical. Securities firms are very attractive investments now because most have performed well for the past few years. That certainly has not always been the case, however, and may not always be. The financial services field is becoming both more capital- and labor-intensive, some analysts say. As noted, to efficiently serve a mass market, huge sums must be invested in technology. And it takes highly paid executives - a lot of them - to deal with the more sophisticateded individualized needs of upscale customers.\n\nFinally, what seems to be highly profitable often isn't. Take the money-market funds, which have attracted more than $175 billion in the last few years. Merrill Lynch, whose money-market fund accounts for about one-fifth of the market, doesn't claim that the fund itself is making any money. Merrill hopes that the fund will generate other, more profitable, business.\n\nThat was the dream commercial banks lived with for years, until competition forced them to figure out whether they really were earning money on many of their services. The answer, for the most part, turned out to be no, and that is why many banks today are raising the price of their consumer services.\n\nEach financial service, as many banks have learned to the tune of heavy losses, is a very different business. Because a company knows how to make mortgages does not mean it knows how to make a personal loan or underwrite insurance.\n\nBut the trend toward financial conglomeration is real and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, as witnessed by the following vignettes of a number of nonbank companies that have become significant factors in the financial-services business.","Eric Gill was sex mad so it’s probably no surprise that his design for a stone lawn roller would be smutty, showing a naked Adam and Eve literally enjoying a roll in the Garden of Eden.\n\nThe erotic gardening equipment is going on public display at the National Portrait Gallery as part of the first exhibition devoted to William Morris and his influence on 20th-century life.\n\nGill was a fanatic about religion and sex who had sex with most of his family including the family dog, but he was also a hugely important early 20th-century artist, a free thinker who was profoundly influenced by Morris. “I still love Eric Gill for all his many faults,” said the show’s curator, Fiona MacCarthy. “I love the work and I love the exuberance and the craziness of it; an Adam and Eve garden roller is pretty extreme.”\n\nThe roller, designed by Gill and carved by his apprentice David Kindersley, has been loaned by Leeds city art gallery to an exhibition that includes portraits, furniture, jewellery, books, banners and textiles.\n\nThe show explores Morris’s unstinting belief in art for everyone, his passionate socialism and revolutionary zeal and his influence on some of the most brilliantly radical figures of the last 150 years.\n\nHe still has enormous relevance today as well, said MacCarthy. “He is questioning the meaning of life in a way we are still needing to do. Morris is thinking about creativity and about whether humans need to make, which is pertinent in these days of unemployment – people need a creative life, otherwise they just fall into lethargy.”\n\nThe show shines light on a fascinating cast of characters who fell under the spell of Morris, during his lifetime or subsequently.\n\nPeople like Edward Carpenter, the openly gay Victorian philosopher who introduced sandals to leftwing circles with a mission to free believers’ feet from the “coffin-like imprisonment of shoes”.\n\nHis original sandals are on display from Sheffield Archive, while later in the show there are also works representing a man who is the modern living link to Morris, Terence Conran.\n\nThe exhibition is opening in the same week that the Frieze commercial art fair opens and more or less takes over the London art world.\n\nMorris would have hated it, said MacCarthy. “He would have been appalled by Frieze! Can you see him going through Frieze? He would have been knocking it all sideways.”\n\nAnarchy & Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy, 1860-1960 is at the National Portrait Gallery, London, 16 October – 11 January.","ASHINGTON, Feb. 11 - A strategy document outlining proposals for eliminating the threat from Al Qaeda, given to Condoleezza Rice as she assumed the post of national security adviser in January 2001, warned that the terror network had cells in the United States and 40 other countries and sought unconventional weapons, according to a declassified version of the document.\n\nThe 13-page proposal presented to Dr. Rice by her top counterterrorism adviser, Richard A. Clarke, laid out ways to step up the fight against Al Qaeda, focusing on Osama bin Laden's headquarters in Afghanistan. The ideas included giving \"massive support\" to anti-Taliban groups \"to keep Islamic extremist fighters tied down\"; destroying terrorist training camps \"while classes are in session\" and then sending in teams to gather intelligence on terrorist cells; deploying armed drone aircraft against known terrorists; more aggressively tracking Qaeda money; and accelerating the F.B.I.'s translation and analysis of material from surveillance of terrorism suspects in American cities.\n\nMr. Clarke was seeking a high-level meeting to decide on a plan of action. Dr. Rice and other administration officials have said that Mr. Clarke's ideas did not constitute an adequate plan, but they took them into consideration as they worked toward a more effective strategy against the terrorist threat.\n\nThe proposal and an accompanying three-page memorandum given to Dr. Rice by Mr. Clarke on Jan. 25, 2001, were discussed and quoted in brief by the independent commission studying the Sept. 11 attacks and in news reports and books last year. They were obtained by the private National Security Archive, which published the full versions, with minor deletions at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency, on its Web site late Thursday.\n\nUnder the heading \"the next three to five years,\" Mr. Clarke spelled out a series of steps building on groundwork that he said had already been laid, adding that \"success can only be achieved if the pace and resource levels of the programs continue to grow as planned.\"\n\nHe said the C.I.A. had \"prepared a program\" focused on eliminating Afghanistan as a haven for Al Qaeda.\n\nIt would feature \"massive support\" to anti-Taliban groups like the Northern Alliance and the destruction of training camps occupied by terrorists. \"We would need to have special teams ready for covert entry into destroyed camps to acquire intelligence for locating terrorist cells outside Afghanistan,\" he wrote, saying that this would either require Special Operations troops or some other \"liaison force capable of conducting activity on-the-ground inside Afghanistan.\" Predator drones, some of which could be armed, would support those forces, he wrote.\n\nSome of what he proposed in the way of support for the Northern Alliance or for Uzbekistan, which borders Afghanistan to the north, was deleted from the document before it was declassified. But some of the actions he proposed were not intended to be kept secret, like \"overt U.S. military action\" aimed at the command and control of Al Qaeda and the Taliban's military.\n\nThe previously secret documents were at the heart of a fiercely partisan debate over Mr. Clarke's contention, in a book and in public statements, that the Bush administration had ignored his warnings of the imminent danger posed by Mr. bin Laden and his terrorist organization.\n\nThe shorter memorandum was written in response to a request for \"major presidential policy reviews\" worthy of a meeting of \"principals,\" the president's top foreign policy advisers. It began: \"We urgently need such a Principals level review on the al Qida network.\" The word \"urgently\" was italicized and underscored; the \"al Qida\" spelling was used in both documents.\n\n\"We would make a major error if we underestimated the challenge al Qida poses,\" the memorandum said.\n\nThe principals' meeting on Al Qaeda took place, but not until Sept. 4, 2001, a week before the attacks on New York and the Pentagon.","That is why it is important for advisors to also understand how Alzheimer's can take a toll on families affected by the disease and know how to design and implement financial strategies to protect a client's interests.\n\nIts signature mark—memory loss—is distressing. However, it also impedes one's ability to make financial decisions, making it pertinent for at-risk investors to lay out health care and financial plans long before the disease takes its toll.\n\n(Read more: Money matters: A road map for Alzheimer's patients)\n\n\"Family members are already on emotional overload—adding a financial and legal decision aspect to what they're already going through is enormous,\" said Carol Steinberg, president of Alzheimer's Foundation of America, a national nonprofit focused on the care and needs of people with the disease. \"Therefore, the more decisions made earlier on and with the input of the loved one, the easier it is.\"\n\nFinancial planning, of course, can help. Financial experts urge families affected by Alzheimer's to complete a will. That means a living will and durable powers of attorney for health care and finance.\n\nThey also stress discussing insurance options for the financial consequences of the disease. That should include long-term-care insurance, annuities and life insurance with riders that provide a benefit if chronic care is needed.\n\nWhile it makes sense for individuals with a history of dementia in their family to have more of a reason to line things up while the person still has full cognitive ability, these basic steps (wills and insurance options) are things most people should already have in place, financial experts say.\n\n\"Fifty percent of people who come to us don't have their wills done,\" said Holly Kylen, a retirement coach and an independent financial advisor with ING Financial Partners.\n\nAlong with a will, advisors urge investors to review all estate planning documents (like a living trust) and name a durable power of attorney, the person who will make financial decisions when the person with Alzheimer's no longer can handle making those decisions.\n\n(Read more: Alzheimer's disease and health-care costs)\n\n\"In many respects, financial planning should take place before a disease is diagnosed,\" Steinberg said. \"No one has a crystal ball, but it's good to be prepared for whatever chronic disease may be in your future.\"\n\nMany financial advisors recommend appointing a close family member—usually a spouse—as a power of attorney. It should be someone whose relationship with the person with Alzheimer's has a trusted relationship.\n\nBut in the fraught case of dealing with the end-of-life decisions brought about by Alzheimer's, some experts say a family is better off to appoint a third-party who doesn't have an emotional attachment to the investor—or his or her assets.\n\n\"I've (seen) parents who don't trust their kids at all,\" said Christopher Dukes, a certified financial planner and chief executive officer of Dukes Wealth Management. \"That's when I'll tell them to consider someone they're not related and to whom they're not leaving any money.\"\n\nThere's likely a cost associated with working with an outsider, but it's worth the investment because in some cases family arguments and lawsuits can destroy an estate, Dukes said.\n\n(Read more: Do you need a retirement coach?)\n\nWhile some investors may already be using an estate planning attorney to draft a will or a living trust, financial experts believe it makes sense to work with someone well versed in elder care law.\n\nFor instance, an elder care attorney, working in tandem with a financial advisor, can help older individuals who are looking to purchase long-term care insurance. They can also help with health-care directives and creating living wills.\n\nFinancial advisors also stress that families affected by Alzheimer's need to keep the lines of communication open.\n\nWhen the condition of a client diagnosed with Alzheimer's began to worsen, Shomari Hearn, vice president of Palisades Hudson Financial Group, asked the client's wife (who was the power of attorney) to sit in on their meetings so she could become familiar with the decisions she would one day have to make.\n\n(Read more: The race for next-generation of Alzheimer's drugs)\n\nHearn also documented and summarized the conversations to make sure the spouse had important information handy after her husband no longer had the capacity to make the financial decisions.\n\nMost people want to talk about these issues, advisors admit. But because so many people with Alzheimer's cannot communicate in the last few years of their life, it is vital and makes sense to create a good planning strategy to have those types of conversations up front, financial experts say.\n\n—By Maggie Overfelt, Special to CNBC.com.","Thrive Capital, which gained fame with early investments in technology darlings and then began incubating businesses like health insurers, is about to become bigger.\n\nThrive plans to announce on Monday that it has raised $700 million for its fifth fund, pushing the firm’s overall size to just under $1.5 billion.\n\nOver its six years, Thrive has become a quiet force in venture capital.

But in September 2013, when he was volunteering at JetBlue’s Blue Horizon for Autism event, which lets families with autistic kids experience the airport in a controlled setting, he found himself getting along effortlessly with his fellow volunteer, an autistic teenager named Jason Harris. “We started talking about aircraft routing and pairing,” Tim says. “Just by looking at the tail number of a plane, he knew the name of the plane. That’s what I do for a living—I remember thinking, this is fun!” Russo, who manages strategic initiatives within Technical Operations for JetBlue (No. 454), gave Harris his contact information.\n\nRusso has been in touch with Harris every day since, answering his constant questions about aviation over text and email. “I know it sounds unbelievable,” Deb Harris, Jason’s mom, says. “But they talk every single day about flight patterns and JetBlue.” Now, Harris is taking flying lessons so that he can realize his dream of becoming a commercial pilot. But Russo has made sure to introduce his mentee to the whole aviation world: In April, Russo took Harris and his family on a multi-day tour of the JetBlue headquarters and JFK airport, introducing him to all of the teams that work behind the scenes to keep the company running. “That was a magical day for me,” Jason Harris says. Russo – and many other employees at JetBlue who have gotten to know Jason, now 16, over the years – is working with the Harris family to discuss Jason’s career path, and his promising future in aviation. “This experience has been so uplifting for Jason since he’s at the stage in his life where he’s trying to figure out what he’s going to do as an adult,” Deb Harris says. “Tim has given us strong direction and a lot of support.”","But for Terry the loan denial was not an impediment. She turned to her 401(k) and maxed seven credit cards to get the $150,000 she needed for her business.\n\nTerry's risk is now paying off. Her lingerie line, two years young, is being sold at major retailers such as Macy's and jcpenney.com.\n\nOther challenges that minority businesses face is profitability and survival rate. About 50 percent of all small businesses survive five years or more, and only one-third survive 10 years or more. And according to an SBA report, \"Women and minority-owned firms tend to be smaller and less profitable … and they carry lower survival rates than their male or nonminority counterparts.\"\n\n\"Smaller loan sizes seem to be linked to higher failure rates. Access to credit is a big barrier,\" Lisa D. Cook, an associate professor of economics at Michigan State University and a former member of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. \"Most of minority-owned businesses are located in their local communities, and if their local communities are poorer than other communities, they're going to have a lot less growth potential.\"\n\nAnother challenge that could hamper business growth among blacks and Hispanics is the lingering effect of the housing crisis, Cook said.\n\n\"A lot of their wealth for 2008 was tied up in housing,\" she explained. \"It's not easy to get a mortgage anymore. ... Home-equity loans can't be counted on as they were before to finance start-ups.\"\n\nA study found that minority homeowners were disproportionately affected by the foreclosure crisis.\n\nHome ownership often serves as collateral for those who want to start their business and can also help decrease the probability of loan denials.\n\n\"Home equity can serve as a relatively low-cost financing alternative,\" the SBA says. \"Absence of home ownership may also serve as a barrier to entry for prospective women and minority entrepreneurs.\"\n\nRead MoreWhat global warming means for your grocery bill\n\nAnother challenge Cook sees among blacks and Hispanics—whose businesses are mostly in the service and manufacturing industries—is their lack of representation in the innovative economy, or science and technology economy, which she says is the fastest growing economy.\n\nAsians, however, fare well in the STEM (science, technology,engineering) industry holding 15 percent of all stem jobs, according to the Census.\n\nBlacks held 6 percent of STEM jobs, while Hispanics held 7 percent.\n\nThe Obama administration hopes to alleviate some of the hurdles small-business owners face—in particular, among minority—with the appointment of the new SBA administrator, Maria Contreras-Sweet, who was born in Mexico.","It turns out all that hand wringing over millennials ditching cars for fixies, Uber rides, and mass transit might have been premature.\n\nMillennials are acquiring cars; they’re just not buying them. Instead, millennials are opting to lease more luxurious, tech-forward cars than they could otherwise afford to buy.\n\nMillennials are not only opting to lease vehicles at higher rates than the overall car-buying population, they’re hungry for bigger, more luxurious ones, according to an analysis released by car-buying platform Edmunds on Tuesday. Millennials are particularly attracted to leasing Ram, GMC, and Lexus brands.\n\nLeasing has accounted for 28.9% of all new car purchases of millennials ages 18 to 34 in 2015, according to Edmunds’ analysis of car registration data provided by Polk. The percentage exceeds the industry-wide lease penetration rate of 26.7%. It’s also reflects a 46% jump in leasing by millennials over the last five years. By comparison, the share of leasing among all car shoppers has increased 41.7% during that period.\n\nMillennials’ leasing rate outpaces the total population in every one of Edmunds’ 24 vehicle segments except for one: compact cars.\n\nThis doesn’t mean millennials are living beyond their means. They are technically staying within their budgets.\n\nA survey of millennials conducted in June by Edmunds and Morpace Inc. found that 57% of respondents said they’re willing to put no more than $2,999 down on a new car purchase, and 54.9% said they’re willing to pay no more than $299 per month. Using those figures, shoppers who finance their purchase are limited to vehicles priced under $20,000. However, shoppers who are willing to lease can use the same upfront and monthly budget toward a vehicle prices as high as $35,000.\n\nWhen they do lease, the cars and trucks they pick are big, lean towards luxury, and are tech-centric. Edmunds found that millennials who acquire a new Ram truck are 30% more likely to lease it than the general population. Other top brands that millennials are more likely to lease include GMC (26.1% more likely), Lexus (23.9% more likely), Jaguar (21.8% more), and Cadillac (20.5% more likely). The remaining car brands that round out the millennial leasing list include Buick, Subaru, Scion, Mini, and Acura, according to Edmunds.\n\nWhile there is any hard evidence yet, the leasing trend among millennials is likely being driven by technology, Jessica Caldwell, director of industry analysis at Edmunds, told Fortune in an email.\n\n“Leasing allows car shoppers to effectively get into a new vehicle every two to three years, which isn’t dissimilar to people’s smartphone rotation,” Caldwell said. “Being guaranteed a new vehicle in a short time frame ensures that one will be up-to-date with the latest in-car technologies.”\n\nMany automakers are poised to take advantage of this appetite for tech and luxury. Manufacturers are finally realizing that their vehicles aren’t just tools of transport, they’re smartphones on wheels. Millennials, it seems, have realized this, too, as they pursue the latest tech-friendly vehicles under financial models similar to other must-have tech devices.","06/11/2014 at 08:00 PM EDT\n\nWith the success of her hit show,\n\ncan't help but feel blessed.\n\n\"I am living extraordinary dreams come true in my work life and in my personal life,\" she told the\n\nin her first interview since welcoming\n\nWhile her character on ABC's political thriller may have a very complicated personal life, Washington, 37, says playing the role of Olivia Pope has rubbed off on her in a positive way.\n\n\"She is unapologetically willing to take control of a situation,\" says Washington. \"I think I've learned a lot from her about how to own my own power in a room or in a professional situation.

Many scientists were sceptical when he arrived: what would an artist do exactly? But they have come to see that he is asking serious questions about their work, and two public exhibitions have emerged out of his residency.\n\nFiner has built a 10 metre wooden spiral tower supporting a huge dish: called The Centre of the Universe, it can be seen in the University parks this month. Part sculpture, part scientific instrument, this is a working radio telescope, receiving information from outer space. The invisible waves picked up by the antenna are \"translated\" into visual data in a garden shed next to the installation.\n\nThe technology makes strange, deep sounds. Finer is hoping to record a meteor shower: they sound, he says, \"particularly beautiful\".\n\nSome of his work is more down to earth. As part of an exhibition called 2015: Dreams, Plans, Visions (opening at Modern Art Oxford on June 9), Finer asked various people - astrophysicists, schoolchildren, artists - to make a map of Oxford and a map of the universe. The maps are strung from the ceiling at head height in a maze. There are drawings, collages made with hair, abstract paintings and word diagrams. Often it is hard to tell the difference between someone's map of Oxford and their representation of the universe.\n\nFiner's work draws connections between the enormous timescales involved in cosmology and the human scale of a personal relationship with an environment. But another of his successes has been in bringing people together: some of the people in the astrophysics department have formed a band, called the Big-Eyed Beans From Venus.","SAN SALVADOR, March 4— President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador said today that no ''preparations'' had been made for negotiations with the leaders of the leftist guerrillas.\n\nSources close to the President said that a trip to West Germany he had planned for the weekend had been canceled, apparently out of fear of a right-wing coup.\n\nAt the same time, the United States Embassy issued a statement opposing any attempt at a coup. The comment came after the embassy was the target of shots fired from a passing truck.\n\nNo one was injured by the burst of five or six shots, but Frederic L. Chapin, the American charge d'affaires, drew a connection between the shooting and the fears of a coup, saying that the United States had ''no intention of being intimidated.''\n\nIn a sign of support for President Duarte, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. said today that a right-wing coup would have ''serious consequences'' for continued United States aid to El Salvador and that a call for Mr. Duarte's ouster ''does not represent United States policy in any way.'' (Page A9.)\n\nThe concern over a coup was raised yesterday when Roberto D'Aubuisson, a former army intelligence major who still commands the loyalty of a number of right-wing officers, denounced any negotiations between the governing junta and the leftist guerrillas and strongly hinted that a coup might be attempted this month. Backing for Regime Voiced\n\nThe statement read by Mr. Chapin said that while there was no proof, the attack on embassy had the ''hallmarks of a D'Aubuisson operation'' and added, ''The United States Government supports President Duarte and his Government and we oppose a coup and anyone who seeks to change the Duarte Government.''\n\nThe Reagan Administration has until now focused its concern on what it says is international Communist aid to the guerrillas and has appeared to avoid involvement in internal politics. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. D'Aubuisson said that he had the impression that the Administration would not oppose a military takeover.\n\nFifty years of right-wing dictatorships in El Salvador ended 17 months ago when reform-minded officers staged their own coup. They have since joined with Mr. Duarte and his Christian Democratic Party in trying to find a middle ground between the two political extremes and to institute economic changes such as land redistribution to aid peasants. They have promised elections for next year.\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Chapin said: ''We support the Government of El Salvador in its move to implement existing reforms. And we further fully support the processes leading to elections for a constituent assembly and full national elections.''\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Chapin said the primary threat remained the war waged by Marxist guerrillas and not a coup from the right. In suggesting that Mr. D'Aubuisson might be behind the attack on the embassy, Mr. Chapin noted that an apparently identical truck had been used in a similar attack last May when Mr. D'Aubuisson was under arrest. Arrest of Rightist Asked\n\nAt a news conference today, Mr. Duarte called for the arrest of Mr. D'Aubuisson, saying that his remarks yesterday were ''practically a call for a coup.''\n\nMr. D'Aubuisson was arrested in May for an attempted coup but was released shortly afterwards for supposed lack of evidence. He has since moved secretly back and forth between Guatemala and El Salvador, though there had been no formal call for his arrest until today.\n\nArresting him would be a ticklish matter. Most of the the military high command supports the junta, but many younger officers are reportedly supporters of Mr. D'Aubuisson.\n\nAmerican officials have charged that he is in the service of wealthy right-wing families, many of them now in Miami, who have been economically undercut by the junta's changes. Bullet Enters Embassy\n\nToday's shooting occurred at about 11 A.M., when a gray pickup truck with four men in the double cab came around a landscaped traffic circle at a corner of the embassy. Witnesses reported hearing both automatic and semiautomatic fire from one or two guns.\n\nSalvadoran National Guard troops guarding the embassy said they threw themselves to the ground as the bullets struck the metal picket fence surrounding the modernistic embassy and punctured a metal lamppost. One bullet entered the ground-floor cashier's office in the embassy.\n\nNo fire was returned and the truck continued around the circle and left. Mr. Chapin, in private meetings since his arrival, has been urging military and business leaders to back the junta. Western sources said the attack appeared to be an attempt to intimidate embassy personnel and keep them from blocking a coup.\n\nMr. Duarte was careful today not to rule out a future trip to Europe, saying, ''Up to this moment I have not made any decision.'' He said he had been invited to attend the conference of Union of World Christian Democrats now under way in Brussels. He said he received a second invitation to attend a follow-up conference of West German Christian Democrats in Bonn this weekend, and that the German Foreign Ministry had invited him to make an official visit.\n\n''I cannot go at this moment,'' he said, ''unless it would be absolutely necessary.''\n\nIllustrations: photo of Jose Napoleon Duarte","With 7:27 left in the game, Jose Calderon spotted Derrick Williams steamrolling toward the Knicks’ basket. So Calderon unleashed an alley-oop that Williams stuffed.\n\nCalderon was at the Bulls’ 3-point line.\n\nTransition defense — actually, any defense — was not on the Bulls’ menu Thursday at the Garden. But defense, aggressive plays, fun plays, were definitely on the Knicks’ side — along with Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nAnthony scored 26 points, added seven rebounds and four assists while Porzingis, in a 19-point and 10-rebound effort, notched his 20th double-double of the season and second in two nights as the Knicks topped the Bulls, 106-94, at the Garden. The victory gave the Knicks a home-and-home sweep and consecutive wins for the first time in over two months.\n\n“I thought the level of energy we played with, the way we got off to fast starts and then multiple guys contributed out there,” said Anthony when asked to explain how the Knicks, bordering on official playoff extinction, could come up with successive victories over a team trying for the playoffs.\n\nAnd those victories left the Bulls, who were without Pau Gasol (knee), searching.\n\n“I have never been so frustrated before. It was disappointing,” said Chicago’s Taj Gibson, who scored 10 points in support of a game-high 30 from Derrick Rose and 19 from Jimmy Butler.\n\nBut while the Bulls (36-35) were frustrated and disappointed, the Knicks (30-43) were ecstatic, near giddy. You know, 68-foot alley-oop pass plays can do that. And defense that stopped the Bulls in their 41.6 percent shooting tracks can do that, too.\n\n“We realized what the game plan was. We really focused on defense,” said the 7-foot-3 rookie Porzingis, who shot 7-of-15 from the floor, one night after registering his personal high of 29 points. “We knew that was going to win us the game, and I think we did a better job in the second half. And offensively, the game was going our way.”\n\nA good example was right before halftime. After Calderon nailed a left-corner 3-pointer at 4:43 of the second quarter, the Knicks led 45-36. But Chicago rallied, pulling within 47-45, when Gibson scored at 2:35. So then came the ball movement that interim coach Kurt Rambis extolled.\n\n“Their ability to get to spots on the floor, get organized, allows them to be efficient offensively,” Rambis said.\n\nEnter offensive efficiency — from Williams, who scored 13 points off the bench, from Arron Afflalo, who scored 11 in his fifth turn in six games as a reserve after 56 starts, from Sasha Vujacic, who scored all nine of his points on a triple of 3s in the first quarter and of course from Anthony and Porzingis.\n\nTwice taking feeds from Anthony, Porzingis banged home two 3s 30 seconds apart, and the Knicks waltzed into halftime leading 53-45.\n\n“It was just a matter of taking advantage of what they were doing. We knew they were coming on the dribble in the post, to double-team,” Anthony said. “Somebody was open. A lot of times it was KP. So it was a matter of me making the right decision.\n\n“A lot of times, in his position, he’s trailing and his man is in the paint,” Anthony said. “So it’s a matter of him actually making the shot.”\n\nSaid Porzingis, who had been slumping (shooting .333 over nine games before Wednesday), “I’ve been working a lot on my shot.”\n\nNow, as effective as those shots were, the two that got the biggest rise from the crowd were those Calderon-to-Williams feeds.\n\n“It was nice. We have a good connection out there every time we play together. So it was the right play to make,” Calderon said, agreeing the first heave was “your basic 68-foot” alley-oop.\n\n“He’s an amazing passer,” Williams said. “We don’t get to practice that much. The practice is in the game.”","The co-founder of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers shocked many by comparing wealthy Americans to Jews in Nazi Germany, Re-code reported.\n\nIn a letter to the editor in The Wall Street Journal, Tom Perkins wrote that he wanted to \"call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its 'one percent,' namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the 'rich.'\"\n\nTo read the full article, click here.","OSLO, Aug. 22 - The Norwegian police were scouring the country on Sunday for \"The Scream\" - Edvard Munch's masterpiece of existential angst and one of the world's most famous paintings - after armed robbers grabbed it and another painting off the wall of a crowded museum and sped off in a black station wagon.\n\nThe painting, which features a haunted-looking stick of a man howling on a bridge under a sunset, is an icon of the modern Expressionist school of painting and has been replicated humorously on coffee mugs, T-shirts and shower curtains the world over. The other stolen painting, \"Madonna,\" is perhaps the second best-known image by the artist.\n\n\" 'The Scream' is in a league by itself,\" said Franck Giraud, a New York art dealer and a former head of modern art at Christie's. \"It's almost impossible to value, but if it were for sale today, it could sell for over $100 million and become the most expensive painting in the world.\"\n\nArt experts said that given the fame of both \"The Scream\" and \"Madonna,\" it would be nearly impossible to sell them to a collector. They speculated instead that the thieves would demand some form of ransom. That is what happened in 1994, when another version of \"The Scream\" was stolen and later recovered.\n\nIn the theft on Sunday, two robbers, wearing dark ski hats over their faces, burst into the Munch Museum in Oslo at 11:10 a.m. and threatened unarmed guards with pistols, the police said.\n\nSpeaking in Norwegian, one of the men held two guards at gunpoint, ordering them to the floor, while the other used a wire cutter to clip the framed paintings free of the wall, museum officials said. Witnesses described the thieves as clumsy, even dropping the paintings on the way out. A silent alarm alerted the police.\n\n\"One of the guards, a woman, had to be sent to the hospital because she was in such shock, but no one was physically injured and the police were here in under a minute,\" said a museum spokeswoman, Jorun Christoffersen. \"There happened to be a police patrol right in the neighborhood, but it all happened so fast that the thieves were gone.\"\n\nTwo hours later, less than a mile away, the police found shattered wooden frames and glass from the stolen works - a discovery that caused art experts to fear that the two treasures might already have been damaged.\n\n\"They are very fragile, I'm afraid,\" said the director of the Munch Museum, Gunnar Sorensen, said in an interview. He said \"The Scream\" in particular, painted in tempera on cardboard measuring about 33 inches by 25 inches, could be irreparably damaged if bent. The slightly larger \"Madonna,\" another ghostly composition, was painted in oil on canvas and is more likely to survive intact without its protective frame, he said.\n\nThe getaway car, an Audi station wagon, was found in northern Oslo. Witnesses said it had been driven by a third man, also masked. The police said they were examining the car and the discarded frames for fingerprints or DNA evidence.\n\nThe version of \"The Scream\" stolen in 1994 had been hanging in the National Gallery, also in Oslo, when burglars entered through a window before opening time.\n\nThree months later - after the government refused to pay a $1 million ransom demand - four Norwegian men were arrested in an elaborate sting operation in which British undercover agents from Scotland Yard posed as representatives of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and offered to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure the painting and return it to the National Gallery in Oslo, said Leif A. Lier, the lead detective on the case and a former assistant police chief in Oslo.\n\n\"The important thing was that we got the picture back,\" said Mr. Lier, who today is a private detective. That alternate version of \"The Scream\" can still be seen in the National Gallery.\n\nMr. Lier said he was astounded that robbers a decade later could charge into the Munch Museum in broad daylight, with close to 80 people milling around in the galleries, and escape with two priceless works of art.\n\n\"Hasn't the city of Oslo learned anything about security in 10 years?\" he asked. \"I am shocked that once again it was so easy.\"","For WGBH radio host Brian O’Donovan , growing up in Ireland during the 1960s and ’70s, Christmas shone a like a warm beacon of light over those dark social and economic times.\n\nThe season still holds a special place in his heart. “I believe strongly that Christmastime gives us a license to be sentimental in ways we’d hold ourselves back from at other times of the year, and music is a great way to express that,” said O’Donovan, 55.\n\nIn 2003, he launched his own holiday concert, “A Christmas Celtic Sojourn.” Returning this year for its 11th season, O’Donovan and music director Seamus Egan will be joined by a world-class lineup of Celtic musicians, singers, and dancers.\n\nTo get us in the spirit, O’Donovan shared a list of his favorite holiday albums of all time.\n\n1. Sarah McLachlan, “Wintersong” “I’ve always loved her singing. She takes a romantic approach to Christmas music. Christmas is a time for romance and being with the one you love and this is the perfect backdrop for a get-together.”\n\n2. The Sweetback Sisters, “The Sweetback Sisters’ Country Christmas Sing-Along Spectacular” “This has become my favorite album of the last two years. [It] takes classic, mostly secular songs that are popular in America and does exactly what the name suggests. I challenge anybody out there to not sing along with every track.”\n\n3. Nat King Cole, “Merry Christmas” “At Christmastime, we can feel nostalgic for an era, especially in the United States, when many of us weren’t even alive. I think Nat King Cole captures that distinctly American World War II and postwar-era Christmas nostalgia like no other.”\n\n4. The Chieftains, “The Bells of Dublin” “I had to put an Irish or Celtic album on the list. It came out many years ago and really was one of the definitive albums that took Christmas music and gave it that distinct Irish flavor.”\n\n5. The Roches, “We Three Kings” “They have a very distinct type of harmony and delivery in their regular music. When they applied it to Christmas music, they came out with very singable songs. ‘Star of Wonder’ is my favorite off of the album.”\n\nA Christmas Celtic Sojourn with Brian O’Donovan comes to Cutler Majestic Theatre at Emerson College, Dec. 19-22.

(AAP)\n\nA Chinese city has banned schools from holding Christmas events, highlighting official suspicions about the increasingly popular festival because of its foreign origins.\n\nChina's Christian population, currently estimated at around 60 million, is rapidly growing and Christmas is increasingly marked in the country ruled by the officially atheist Communist Party.\n\nBut the government education bureau in Wenzhou, an eastern Chinese coastal city sometimes called \"China's Jerusalem\" because of its large Christian population, banned schools from holding \"Christmas-related\" events, the Global Times reported.\n\nLocal officials \"hope schools can pay more attention to Chinese traditional festivals instead of Western traditions\", said the tabloid, which has close ties to the Communist Party.\n\nInterest in Christmas has grown in China as an occasion for shopping, with marketeers using everything from saxophones and Smurfs to steam trains to get consumers to open their wallets.\n\nBut authorities in Wenzhou this year launched a demolition campaign aimed at local churches, with more than 400 forced to remove visible crosses and some completely destroyed.\n\nThe ban came as a university in central China required students to watch a documentary about Chinese sage Confucius instead of celebrating Christmas.\n\n\"Be good sons and daughters of your country, stand against kitsch Western holidays,\" a banner on the campus of Northwest University in the ancient city of Xi'an said, according to photographs posted online.\n\n\"Resist the expansion of Western culture,\" read another.\n\nCollege students wearing traditional Chinese clothing hold slogans in a campaign to boycott Christmas celebrations on a street in Changsha city, central China’s Hunan province.

The project’s cost will likely exceed $1 billion, according to Eversource spokeswoman Caroline Pretyman, although no formal estimate has been made public. Lee Olivier, executive vice president of strategy and business development at Eversource, said the company is initially investing $10 million but will spend much more as the project progresses.\n\nThe companies hope to take advantage of a state law passed earlier this year that will require big electric utilities — mainly Eversource and National Grid — to purchase large amounts of offshore wind power on contracts of 15 to 20 years. Wind-power producers that reach agreements with utilities would be guaranteed a long-term source of revenue. The joint venture could also provide Eversource with some of the wind power it will need to buy.\n\nThe precise size of the wind farm — including the number of turbines that will be built — likely will depend on how much energy the state’s utility companies agree to buy from Bay State Wind and the type of equipment used to build the machines.\n\nGet Talking Points in your inbox:\n\nAn afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays.\n\nBut Olivier said the power generated by Bay State Wind will become increasingly important as older power plants shut down. One of them — the coal-powered Brayton Point plant in Somerset — is expected to halt operations next year.\n\n“If you have to repower the region, we should be doing it more with renewable energy,” Olivier said. “Clearly, this joint venture is very much aligned with where policy makers want to go.”\n\nOver time, utilities will be required to buy up to 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind electricity — enough for about 800,000 homes, according to an Eversource estimate. Utilities will begin the process of buying the wind power in 2017, putting contracts for at least 400 megawatts of power out to bid.\n\nThe partnership with DONG Energy comes after the European company entered the region in 2015 by securing development rights to a 300-square-mile area of ocean off Martha’s Vineyard.\n\n“When we set up shop here in Massachusetts, quite quickly we were having discussions with Eversource about offshore wind and how far it’s gone in Europe,” said Thomas Brostrom, general manager for DONG’s US wind operations.\n\nEversource and DONG each bring specific expertise to the deal. The Massachusetts utility specializes in transmission, and its executives know about the region’s power grid; DONG brings years of experience in building and operating offshore wind farms.\n\nFor Eversource, the wind farm will mark the company’s first significant power-generation project in years. In the 1990s, when the state deregulated the energy industry, Eversource’s predecessor companies in Massachusetts — including Boston Edison — spun off most of their power plants to focus on distribution.\n\nOlivier said Eversource is allowed to invest in power generation, as long as it is done through an unregulated subsidiary that does not pass the project’s costs directly to consumers. Shareholder money, rather than revenue from ratepayers, will fund the venture, the company said.\n\nBut the arrangement concerns some industry officials because a company Eversource is invested in will now be bidding to sell energy to Eversource.\n\n“It’s going to get a long-term contract from a utility, and in this case, it’s the subsidiary of the affiliate,” said Cynthia Arcate, chief executive of PowerOptions, which buys energy in bulk for nonprofits. She suggested a third party — such as the state — should mitigate the potential conflicts by soliciting wind power bids on Eversource’s behalf.\n\nPretyman, the Eversource spokeswoman, said state and company policies would ensure “transparency and fairness” in the bidding process.\n\nBay State Wind could face at least two competitors in the bidding for contracts with Massachusetts utilities. Deepwater Wind and OffshoreMW also have lease rights to offshore areas south of Massachusetts. Deepwater Wind this week became the first company to produce offshore wind in the United States, when its five-turbine farm blew to life off Block Island in Rhode Island.\n\nDeepwater Wind chief executive Jeff Grybowski said he expects Eversource would “deal fairly” with Bay State Wind competitors during the bidding process. He said he considers Eversource’s investment as a positive step for the industry.\n\n“It’s a strong sign that offshore wind is about to become a reality in the United States,” he said. “We have big, established utilities getting involved in the business.”\n\nOffshoreMW could not be reached for comment.\n\nEversource, when it was still known as Northeast Utilities, had previously agreed to buy wind power from the controversial Cape Wind project. It pulled out of the agreement in early 2015 after the project missed a deadline to secure financing and begin construction, a massive setback for a project whose future is now bleak.","Parenthood will come to a tearful end on Jan. 29 after six emotional seasons on NBC. The show has been the work of a large ensemble, but it’s hard not to pinpoint Lauren Graham’s efforts as a standout. Graham joined the cast as single mom Sarah Braverman in 2010 after the show had already been picked up by the network and found a way to bring a positive spin to the character’s ongoing trials and tribulations. The actress wrapped Gilmore Girls in 2007, a series that remains her most iconic work, and appeared in movies like Evan Almighty and Because I Said So in the interim.\n\nAs Parenthood draws to a close, with its final episodes kicking off Jan. 8, Graham is looking forward to taking time off before beginning a new series. She co-wrote the new endeavor, Kate On Later, with Liz Tuccillo, a comedy that will center on the world of late-night network television talk shows. We visited Graham on the set of Parenthood during one of its final episodes to discuss what it means for this show to find its ending and what it’s meant for Graham as an actress, as well as what she thinks of Gilmore Girls all these years later.\n\nTIME: How do you feel about Parenthood coming to an end?\n\nLauren Graham: It’s very strange. It’s like any big life moment – it’s hard to feel it all. We had our celebration for the 100th episode recently and Ron Howard was there, which is the second time I’ve ever seen him so you know it was a big day. That felt like something. It’s nice that we know it’s the end so we can treasure these last days. Gilmore Girls was just yanked away. I got a phone call when I was sitting in a restaurant. The guy came over and was like, “Excuse me, are you Lauren Graham? Your agent is on the phone.” My agent said, “It’s over.” I didn’t get to say goodbye to anybody. It was a very abrupt end, so this is preferable.\n\nYou get to actually wrap up the story.\n\nYeah, exactly. With Gilmore Girls we did an episode that could be the end, but that’s not how you want to say goodbye to characters you’ve lived with for such a long time. Hopefully this will be satisfying for people.\n\nMORE: TIME’s Review of Parenthood Premiere\n\nThis show has now been an integral part of your daily life for six seasons. What is it like to not have that anymore?\n\nThat’s the life of an actor. You have these connections and then it’s goodbye. It’s unrealistic to take all of them with you. This is unique in that there are a number of people who I don’t even think of as part of the show. They’re just part of my life. It eases the transition, I guess. There are people I know I will see. But it’s also exciting. Part of the actor thing too is that you play pretend at something for a while and then you get to tell a new story. Beside the panic of never working again, the excitement of the possibilities is great, too.\n\nMaura Tierney was originally cast as Sarah Braverman, but had to drop out of the role to focus on treatment for breast cancer. You’re now very strongly identified with the character, but is it strange that you were never meant to be her?\n\nIt was painful. It was a hard thing to be excited about a new job but also be asked about someone’s personal life, which I never comment on. It was unusual. But I just felt fortunate to have an opportunity to play this character. I didn’t know what I wanted to do [after Gilmore Girls] and some of the stuff I tried didn’t work. Honestly, Parenthood was not what I planned. I didn’t plan to do another drama. I didn’t plan to play a single mom. I didn’t plan, even, to do an ensemble show. But I hadn’t found anything I liked as much. I just connected to the show. But that’s the funny thing about this business, you have to make a plan and then be open to it not working out.\n\nWhat do you like about Sarah as a character?\n\nAt times, it’s been frustrating. I was drawn to her because she’s an opposite to what I’d done on TV before. It appealed to my dramatic actor part of me. Where Lorelei Gilmore had a positive spin on everything, this was someone who felt tired and had really struggled. That was appealing to me having done something that was peppy and heroic. But I would rail against that. I didn’t want her to struggle anymore. I would get frustrated on the character’s behalf. Over the years, I tried to bring her into a more positive place and really develop the relationships with the kids.\n\nShe’s doing better this season, especially in her romantic relationships, which have been frustrating to watch her struggle with over the past seasons.\n\nYeah. That’s something I’ve railed against, too. In a way, of course, everyone is looking for love, but I didn’t want her to be defined by whether she’s happy with a man. I did have quite a parade of different guest actors I got to play with on the show. I think there will be resolution in that, finally.\n\nDo you feel satisfied with the ending Sarah gets on the show?\n\nI think it’s satisfying, but I think it’s a little polarizing. There are people who have liked her with different guys. But this makes sense. The other side of getting to do an ending is that everyone has an opinion about what it should be, including myself and the writers and the other actors. It’s raised the anxiety. As nice as it will be to have an ending, it’s also very personal.\n\nMORE: Comedy Show Starring Lauren Graham in the Works\n\nIs there one scene over the course of the series that was the most memorable to shoot?\n\nThey sort of all blur. I love the dynamic with the kids. We were all talking about a scene the other day where I’m trying to tell them about drugs and alcohol and the evils and they’re making fun of me behind my back. We had a great time in the car doing that. In another, partially because Peter [Krause] directed the episode, we’re looking through Jason Ritter’s yearbook and Peter had the idea to put him in a dorky wrestling outfit. We laughed and laughed. Everybody contributes on this show and some of those little innovations have made things special. I always like all the family scenes, too, which is every director’s nightmare because you can’t get anybody to shut up.\n\nParenthood is notorious for making everyone cry every week, often because the actors are put in such emotional circumstances. How difficult is it to channel that?\n\nIt’s completely unbelievable to me that the show – or myself – is known for that because I went through most of drama school never crying. I always saw myself as a comedic actor and wacky best friend. I never imagined I would be in this situation. Part of it is the show does it to you. In the beginning I worried it was too much, like, “Do people cry this much in their real lives?” But the emotional charge of these scenes is actually so high that I’m not trying to cry. In fact this season and last season, I’m trying not to be emotional because I don’t want to be manipulative if it’s not truthful and doesn’t belong. But I do appreciate that it’s something to look forward. I feel the fans have embraced that as “Here’s my hour where I can identify with these people, but it’s not me so I can enjoy crying or enjoy having an emotional release.” That’s our jobs as storytellers, to make a connection. I’m proud of that. It’s become like a club.\n\nDo you still see yourself as a comedic actress?\n\nI do, yeah. That’s just the way I come in to most things, with “What’s funny about this?” If I make additions or changes to scenes, that’s what it is. I’m trying to lighten it. That’s why I think Lorelei was such a fun character for me, because that athletic language and take on things is what I like. But now I will do a half-hour comedy show.\n\nWhat do you hope Parenthood’s legacy will be in television and pop culture?\n\nThis show is about all the iconic moments of life – birth, death, marriage, conflict, loss, hope, joy. In each of these characters we have some moments that most people – or many people – go through in life. Here are all the things that life might bring and here are some people either succeeding or failing. I don’t know why shows about that are so few and far between. It takes a unique combination to just make stories about people interesting enough, with no crimes to solve or law cases. It’s relatable. It’s a show about family.\n\nThere truly are not a lot of shows on TV right now that are this sincere.\n\nThere’s so much more out there so how do you get someone’s attention? You can do it by plot twists and turns, or elements of magic, or giant worlds like Game of Thrones. So the competition for attention is huge. Everybody wants noisy. And that’s not what I want. Shows like this are hard to sell. They trusted [creator] Jason [Katims] because he had done that on a successful, popular show like Friday Night Lights, which was basically about people’s lives.\n\nGilmore Girls, which was also notably sincere, recently came out on Netflix. Have you paid attention to the massive response that’s gotten?\n\nYeah! It’s so gratifying. We didn’t have that streaming then. I knew things live on in reruns, but even that was sort of a shock when younger girls would talk about it and had found it. It’s like 150 episodes of a show that’s basically happy, warm-hearted and a fun world, in this world of zombies and vampires and really gruesome shows, to binge-watch. There’s a nostalgia for spending time in a happier, kinder land.\n\nMORE: All 153 Episodes of Gilmore Girls Are Coming to Netflix\n\nDo you look back on Gilmore Girls as something that defined you as an actress?\n\nYeah and happily so. I didn’t realize then how perfect a fit that was for me in terms of material and sensibility. As much as I have loved this job and this character [on Parenthood], I feel like Gilmore Girls was just a special match. It’s hard to find a writer with that specific of a voice. I’m super thankful to have had it.\n\nHow much are you like Lorelei as a person?\n\nNo one talks that much or that long, but it’s that thing where you read something and it just clicks. It’s like music. I could hear what [creator] Amy [Sherman-Palladino] intended and it made complete sense to me. I remember an interview with Christopher Reeve where he said, “I choose my jobs based on the feeling that I can’t stand the thought of anyone else doing it.” And that’s how I felt with that. It’s a rare chemistry.\n\nThere’s still a debate over which boyfriend Rory should have ended up with. Do you have a favorite Rory boyfriend?\n\nWell, no, of course not because my career would end. I always loved Jared Padalecki as Dean because it was those early years and they were so sweet together and it was first love. But I loved Milo [Ventimiglia] and Matt [Czuchry], too. Both as people and as good matches in their characters for her. But I can’t pick one or it would be every headline on the Internet.\n\nYou published a novel, Someday, Someday, Maybe, last year. Are you continuing to write fiction?\n\nI’m working on a second book, that’s like a sequel that takes place in LA. The character has her first TV series. What I’m going for in that book is everything that happens before you’re truly famous. I’m so much more interested in those steps and missteps that go into that. I like the idea of her being in her first series, but still nobody knows who she is. What I remember about coming to LA is that suddenly work was as big a presence in my life as my life itself. My work took up all this time and space and it shifts your relationship. I always think, “How did I have the guts to keep going and have this job?”\n\nHow soon will that book come out?\n\nWell, it supposed to be out late spring or early summer. I’m not finished. My editor is having heart attacks.\n\nWhat do you think has given you the confidence and the courage to continue to pursue acting no matter what?\n\nI love doing it so much that I was fighting for the chance to do it for the living. There’s a voice that overpowers the one that says “You can’t do this.” If something didn’t work, I would get a new teacher or take another class or take another turn. Every roadblock I would try to find a way around. But it was hard. Things just came together in the way they sometimes do when I came out to LA. It started being easier. I got enough practice and confidence that it became easier. I don’t know how people do it now. We didn’t have all these things, like American Idol, that make fame look like the prize. I didn’t ever think about becoming known. I’m so thankful not to have had because it kept me focused on “What am working at?” not the exterior of “How does it look and what am I getting?”\n\nDo you feel good about where you are now?\n\nThe nature of this work is that there’s always something new to learn and more to grow. I think there’s a fear of being satisfied. And I am satisfied, but I have so much more I want to do.\n\nRead next: Comedy Show Starring Lauren Graham in the Works\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.","In the 1500s, the place was owned by Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII. The story goes that Cromwell lost his tenure (and his head) in 1540 after a neighbour, Sir George Throckmorton, gave evidence against him when he was tried for treason and heresy, and Throckmorton acquired the property for the knock-down sum of £774 9s 2d. Not that this would buy you much these days.\n\nThe Harveys have divided the castle into five apartments, and added a four-storey circular turret to replace the one demolished in the 19th century. They have also restored nine barn conversions within the 65-acre grounds, and asking prices range from £300,000 up to £2 million. It will be open to the public – no armies required – for a week from September 11 to 20 (oversleycastle.com).\n\n“We envisage the castle as providing lock-up-and-leave properties,” says Harvey. “The kind of place where you chuck your keys to your neighbours while you go off to Spain for three months.”\n\nOversley Castle, left, once owned by Thomas Cromwell, has been split into five apartments.\n\nThis is by no means the only sliced-up castle on the market in the UK. In Aberdeenshire, Hilda Aitken is selling a two-bedroom apartment in Keith Hall House, a 16th-century former castle near Inverurie, for £295,000 (on the market with Strutt & Parker, struttandparker.com).\n\nIs she local? Not at all. She lives in Hornchurch in Essex, and when she first came to visit the house (which is divided into eight apartments), it took her and her husband 10 hours to drive there. Nevertheless, they fell for the property straight away. The castle stands in 26 acres of parkland, with a three-acre lake in the middle, deer in the grounds and an imposing coat of arms over the front entrance.\n\n• In pictures: top class family homes near Britain's best schools\n\n• Video: Inside homes where the art costs more than the walls its hanging on\n\nOf course, two questions immediately spring to mind when a property is shared. The first is, will the upkeep of the grounds require a king’s ransom? Aitken says no. She pays £700 a year. The second question concerns the other occupants. Do they welcome newcomers or do their best to pretend that they are the sole owners of the fortress?\n\n“Quite the reverse,” says Aitken. “Everyone has been very friendly, and the place is so big you don’t feel you’re living right up against each other. I’m sad to be selling, but the journey has just got too far for me now. When I left, though, all the other residents gave me a dinner party to say goodbye.”\n\nIndeed, one of the surprising bonuses of buying a shared castle or stately home is the company of your fellow residents.\n\n“Obviously, it’s dependent on the individuals,” says Andrew Ireland, who lives in the Library Suite at Ottershaw Park, in Chertsey, Surrey. The original Palladian building at Ottershaw was erected in 1762, and has served in various guises: as a Second World War hospital, then as a college, then as a school until 1980, when it was turned into residential apartments.\n\nIt’s not all that often that any of the 13 properties here come on to the market, but the house’s beautifully parquet-floored Octagonal Suite (two bedrooms) has just been put up for sale for £1.5 million (savills.com).\n\n“It’s actually much friendlier than you might imagine,” says Ireland. “The people who choose to live here are often quite successful, with driven personalities, and more often than not are quite gregarious. Each year, we throw three different parties for all the residents.

Even that didn't stop Olbermann from practicing his future calling. On the odd-numbered days, he recalls, \"I just went into my room and started talking to myself.\"\n\nHe's still talking, but now sports fans in some 860,000 homes are listening. Every weeknight at 11 EST, Olbermann, 38, along with his straight man Dan Patrick, 40, anchors a one-hour sports wrap-up peppered with brash humor and trenchant commentary. When he's not doing an impression of Sinatra or Schwarzenegger, Olbermann is making a reference to Alfred Hitchcock or Oscar Wilde. \"He is everything they tell you a sports-caster is not supposed to beâintelligent, sardonic, well-read,\" says Brett Farber, a fellow ESPN anchor.\n\nArmchair jocks love it when Olbermann announces a halftime score as \"Patriotsâ21, Pittsburghâjust watching.\" Or when he chided the Chicago Cubsâafter they picked up their first win of the season on April 20 after 14 lossesâby proclaiming, \"Our long national nightmare is over.\"\n\nOlbermann can be tough on the objects of his ire. He once compiled a list of nearly 300 boo-boos in Ken Burns's ballyhooed PBS documentary Baseball and claimed the filmmaker was \"in great shape to break John Gochnaur's record of 98 errors at shortstop for the Cleveland Blues of 1903.\"\n\nThe sportscaster may be quick with a quip, but he also does his homework. Olbermann works 50 hours a week, during which he writes some 15,000 words of commentary. He considers Magic Johnson's 1991 announcement that he was HIV positive the most significant story he has covered. That night, he says, \"I collapsed onto the couch and fell asleep fully clothed. The sound I woke up to was me crying.\"\n\nThe sound Olbermann often fell asleep to as a boy was that of a baseball game on the radio. His father, Theodore, an architect, and his mother, Marie, a preschool teacher, were both ardent Yankee fans. When Olbermann watched games on TV, he would \"shut the sound off and do his own commentary,\" remembers his mother, who says he not only kept score but recorded the number of pitches thrown per batter and the weather at game time. Says Marie: \"We were concerned it was becoming obsessive.\"\n\nIt was. But when Olbermann entered the Hackley School in Tarry-town, N.Y., in the eighth grade, he caught the eye of Chris Berman, then student sports director for the school's radio station and now ESPN's studio anchor for its pro football and baseball coverage. Berman put him to work announcing school hockey games. \"He was so gung ho,\" says Berman. \"He knew every stat, every player, every sport.\" At Cornell, where he majored in communication arts, Olbermann spent most of his time at the radio station. \"I never went to class,\" he says. Somehow he managed to graduate in 1979. Weeks later he landed a job as a reporter for UPI Radio Network before becoming a sports anchor-reporter for CNN in 1981. He left three years later and put in time at one TV station in Boston and two in L.A. before jumping to ESPN in 1992.\n\nOlbermann hated the reduced focus on sports at local stations. \"One night [KCBS]...said, 'Do you really think it's necessary to run the scores?' \" Olbermann runs the scores and then some at ESPN, which doesn't leave time for much else. That's just as well for the never-married sportscaster, who lives alone near ESPN's headquarters in rural Bristol, Conn., and who says \"there's no possibility of distraction\" when he gets home. \"No distraction, just exhaustion.\"\n\nStill, Olbermann sees himself as a man with a mission. \"I try to emphasize the goodness and human meaning of sports, or else I try to poke a hole in some of the pretentiousness,\" he says. \"I'm not trying to set myself up as America's sports conscience, but somebody's got to be pointing out that the emperor has no clothes.\"","Tanya Plibersek has voiced concerns about a Trump presidency.

''Not that, please not that!'' the author wrote. ''The insect cannot be depicted. It cannot even be shown from a distance.'' The publisher complied, illustrating ''The Metamorphosis'' instead with a door opening into darkness - an image at once more abstract and yet more terrifying. What shakes Kafka's readers, after all, is not the prospect of turning into an insect but the recognition that one can experience the helplessness of an insect before the maze of dark thresholds that is the modern world.\n\nTo understand where the director Martha Clarke has gone both wrong and right with ''The Hunger Artist,'' her new mixed-media theater piece about Kafka at St. Clement's, it helps to imagine her torn constantly between the conflicting impulses to depict the cockroach and the spectral door. An hourlong melange of Kafka fiction and biography, this work often settles for the kind of representational illustration that Kafka rightly assumed would diminish the power of his words. The dancers among the seven-member company, the impressive Rob Besserer and Paola Styron, are too frequently found mimicking the Francis Bacon-like contortions of the stories' human and animal figures - or, with the aid of the child actor David Jon, forming shadowy replicas of Franz's Freudian familial constellation. The actress Brenda Currin, in an atypically shrill turn as an informal narrator, will just as redundantly use her vocal and facial mannerisms to pound in the implications of every twist of plot.\n\nBut Ms. Clarke, an exceptional theater artist whose past works include another Kafka adaptation (''A Metamorphosis in Miniature,'' 1982) and last season's startling ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' is also capable of exposing the anxiety beneath her texts. With the aid of Paul Gallo's exquisitely ominous lighting and Robert Israel's striking set - an expansive graveyard of dark earth in the foreground, a pinched room out of Beckett in the rear - the director does at times open a door on the murky psychological landscape where Kafka's anguished figures reside.\n\nThe most effective - which is to say the most disorienting - sequences invariably feature the actor Anthony Holland. With his checked three-piece suit, bowler hat and pale features, Mr. Holland looks like a refugee from a faded sepia photograph. His soft voice, unpretentiously conversational in tone yet mesmerizingly grave, could be Kafka's: the civilized Old World cadences of Prague are accelerated just a bit by the gallows humor of the paranoid Jewish ghetto comic. The actor lets his middle-aged body work for him, too. When Ms. Clarke gets to her deconstructed capsule retelling of ''The Metamorphosis,'' it is Mr. Holland's stiff, knee-knocking posture in a chair or his subsequent, sluglike crawl through the dirt - not the stylized gesticulations of others behind him - that capture the dreadful burden of being Gregor Samsa, the traveling salesman soon to be discarded with the trash.\n\nFor all the sophistication of the other theatrical means employed in ''The Hunger Artist,'' little of it transports us as much as the utter simplicity of Mr. Holland's acting. In ''Vienna: Lusthaus,'' Ms. Clarke employed the same designers and composer (Richard Peaslee) as well as some of the same performers to take us on an associative, ever-accelerating waltz through the cataclysmic art and history of fin-de-siecle Vienna. Even though the techniques she uses this time are also the same, ''The Hunger Artist'' doesn't gather the cumulative dramatic or intellectual momentum of the last piece - and it isn't as unified as Ms. Clarke's previous, literal-minded re-enactment of Bosch's ''Garden of Earthly Delights.'' Instead, she offers us a fairly arbitrary grab bag of uneven sketches. The segments are stitched together by prettily sung pastiches of Czechoslovak folk songs and by a few artsy tableaux, often featuring a framed photo of Kafka, that invite us to scarcely more stimulating purpose than worshiping at the master's shrine. *\n\nThe text, by the playwright Richard Greenberg (''The Maderati''), is more of a reduction than the intended distillation of its source. The adapter aspires mainly to boil down the few selected stories to Hollywood-film-treatment size - sometimes at the price of a distorting oversimplification. The speeches drawn from Kafka's diaries and letters (to his father and his fiancee, Felice Bauer) are of fortune-cookie brevity and, for those unfamiliar with the writer's life, likely to prove inscrutable. Given the evening's title, metaphors of starvation are emphasized throughout, but the correspondences between the Kafka fable ''A Hunger Artist'' and Kafka's own biography are more subtle than the didactic linkage Mr. Greenberg eventually provides.\n\nMs. Clarke stages that titular story, set in the world of sideshows, as a Fellini circus, with carnality and cruelty lurking behind every tightrope and illusion act. The sequence may have more to do with the director's own signature treatment of eroticism than with the Kafka original, but it is magically choreographed - far more finished than the evening's billing as a ''work in progress'' suggests. It's also to Ms. Clarke's credit that she has avoided most of the banalities of depicting Kafkaesque evil. There are no pro forma excerpts from ''The Trial'' or ''The Castle,'' and - a last-second evocation of a mass grave excepted - no pat visual formulations of totalitarian horror.\n\nIn keeping with this director's past work, ''The Hunger Artist'' tries to present Kafka as a dreamer anyway - as the artist he was, not as the social prophet posterity has found him to be. Ms. Clarke probably comes closest to her goal in the evening's first segment, ''A Country Doctor.'' As the doctor, played by Mr. Holland, advances toward the nightmarish bedside scene of a young patient's death, the nightmare of a servant girl's rape back home, mimed behind him, tugs at his guilty memory. Yet it's Ms. Clarke's imaginative use of the depth of the stage here, more than any recited text or corporal image, that pulls us, at least fleetingly, into the relentless anxiety of the doctor's illogical but completely lucid dream. The difference between Kafka and what follows in ''The Hunger Artist'' is that in Kafka, you don't wake up.

The question is if, at worst, it could be the key to unsolved terrorism dating back two decades. Nowhere do the darker suspicions burn more intensely than in this capital whose appetite for conspiracy theories is insatiable and whose Parliament today began an investigation into where reality may lie.\n\nThe focus of the inquiry is a clandestine operation code-named Gladio, created decades ago to arm and train resistance fighters in case the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies invaded. All this week, there have been disclosures of similar organizations in virtually all Western European countries, including those that do not belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. An Italian Creation\n\nAs disclosed in recent days by the Italian Prime Minister, Giulio Andreotti, Gladio, named after after the short, wide, double-edged sword used by gladiators in ancient Rome, came into being during the most gelid days of the cold war.\n\nIt was originally an Italian creation, said Mr. Andreotti, who is scheduled to testify on Friday before a parliamentary commission studying bombings and massacres that claimed scores of lives in a terrorism wave that inundated Italy from 1969 to the early 1980's.\n\nThe Prime Minister said last week that Gladio later evolved into a branch of an extensive network, operated within NATO and abetted by a 1956 agreement between the United States and Italian secret services. Over the years, he says, 622 Italians belonged to the operation -- civilians who were trained by intelligence operatives and who had fought in World War II or served in the peacetime forces. Preparing the Guerrillas\n\nGermany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and Luxembourg have all acknowledged that they maintained Gladio-style networks to prepare guerrilla fighters to leap into action in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion. Many worked under the code name Stay Behind. Greece called its operation Red Sheepskin.\n\nNews reports in recent days assert that similar programs have also existed in Britain, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Austria, Turkey and Denmark, and even in neutral countries like Switzerland and Sweden. The British newspaper The Guardian today quoted a former Commander in Chief of NATO forces in northern Europe as saying that the purpose was to have a secret organization in place for guerrilla warfare if Britain were overrun by Communist troops.\n\n\"The original plan was to establish a network to arm guerrillas from the civil populace while conventional forces were occupied elsewhere,\" said the former commander, Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley.\n\nDiplomats in Rome and other European capitals say the network was inspired by anti-Nazi resistance movements in World War II, but that it was hoped these new clandestine units would be better organized. \"You have to remember,\" a highly placed Western European official said, \"that at the time everyone was praising the French resistance, the Italian resistance, and everyone had to be prepared.\" Secret Arms Deposits\n\nThese would-be fighters had stockpiles of weapons and explosives, officials say. Henk Vredeling, the Netherlands' Defense Minister in the 1970's, said he had known of weapons caches that were to be used for behind-the-lines sabotage. The German newspaper Die Welt reported that among secret stores of weapons in what used to be West Germany were grenade launchers, pistols and explosives.\n\nIn Rome, Mr. Andreotti disclosed that secret arms deposits were dismantled as far back as 1972 but that the secret services could not find 12 of them. Their disappearance has fueled speculation here that the weapons ended up in terrorist hands. Contributing to this conjecture are press reports that some of the underground \"gladiators,\" as they have been dubbed, had close links to neo-Fascist groups and to intelligence organizations.\n\nBut the chief of Italian military intelligence, Adm. Fulvio Martini, insisted today that Operation Gladio had no ties to right-wing groups and that its only purpose was to resist invasion.\n\n\"Not one of the 622 was ever involved in any conspiracies or plots,\" Admiral Martini said in testimony before the parliamentary commission. Varied From Country to Country\n\nIt appears that Gladio operations varied from country to country. Many worked within a NATO framework, but some -- the Netherlands, for example -- say their resistance fighters were organized purely as a national force.\n\nIn some countries, the networks were shut down years ago. Greece's Socialists say that they discovered theirs when they took power in 1981, finally abolishing it and rounding up weapons in 1985. In France, President Francois Mitterrand said this week that it was he who eliminated the French branch, but he did not say when.\n\nEven in countries like Italy where Gladio remains in force, its members seem to have little fighting spirit left. 'Gladiators' Still Recruited\n\nNew \"gladiators\" are still recruited, and two members of Parliament say they visited a military base on the island of Sardinia where guerrilla training exercises were held last spring. But Admiral Martini told the investigating commission that nearly three-fourths of the 622 members were over the age of 50, or were dead.\n\nNevertheless, the network continues, and several officials reported that a supervisory committee of European secret services met in Brussels only a month ago.\n\nNourishing conspiracy theories are assertions from key European leaders that they knew nothing about the operation until recently. Joseph Luns, who was NATO secretary general from 1971 to 1984, said he had never heard of it. Belgium's Defense Minister, Guy Coeme, told a radio station today that \"things were hidden from me\"\n\nAdmiral Martini told the lawmakers that some Italian Prime Ministers were also kept in the dark. Indeed, as the Gladio story began to unfold, Italy's only two postwar Prime Ministers not to come from the conservative Christian Democratic Party -- Bettino Craxi, a Socialist, and Giovanni Spadolini, a Republican -- insisted that the disclosures came as news to them. Agreement With U.S. Agencies\n\nThere were other disturbing developments for Italian politicians and journalists, who as a group demonstrate a cultivated taste for intrigue and a slender faith in coincidence.\n\nThere was Mr. Andreotti's mention of the 1956 agreement with United States agencies, whose aim for decades was to make sure that the Italian Communist Party, the largest in the West, never got a foothold in the Government. And there were long-reported links between Italian secret services and neo-Fascists.\n\nAnd there is the fact that the major unsolved acts of terrorism that rocked Italy in the 1970's are all presumed to be the work of people on the far right. Left-wing terrorists like the moribund Red Brigades somehow were caught and imprisoned.\n\nSwept up in the dispute is President Francesco Cossiga, who declared recently that it had been his \"privilege\" to help organize Gladio when he was in the Defense Ministry in the 1960's. Some Independent Left members of Parliament have since demanded his impeachment, but Mr. Cossiga remains unflappable.\n\nFact is, he said, \"I admire the fact that we have kept the secret for 45 years.\"\n\nPhoto: Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, who is to testify today about a secret anti-Communist organization formed during the cold war years.

Curbed first reported the listing.\n\nHow did such a property crop up in Oak Glen, a tiny pocket (population 638) in San Bernardino County that’s about an hour and a half from Los Angeles?\n\nThe owner visited Europe, was inspired by a castle there and built a replica out of cut gray stone, according to listing broker JR Allgower. The owner started construction in 1976 and only finished a few years ago.\n\n“His goal was always to live in a castle, to be the king of a castle,” Allgower tells The Post. “It’s taken him a while to get it all together.”\n\nOver the 7-acre estate, there’s also an apple orchard, grape vines and cherry blossom trees. It also abuts the San Bernardino National Forest.\n\n“There are deer, bobcats, bears — so it’s completely enclosed now,” Allgower adds. “There are wrought-iron gates around it.” Whew!\n\nThe interior has modern conveniences (except for central heat and air conditioning) but the decor is medievally inspired — hence the two fireplaces and a tapestry hanging in the great room.\n\nThere are also four two-car garages that the owner has dubbed “stables.”\n\nThe average sale price in the castle’s ZIP code is $316,900, according to Zillow, so this place is pretty steep by comparison.\n\n“It’s a pain in the butt,” jokes a representative who answered the phone at Allgower’s office. “Everyone wants to go see it, but nobody can afford to buy it.”","12/01/2015 AT 03:00 PM EST\n\nhasn't even hit theaters yet and\n\nis already plotting his return to another huge franchise:\n\nThe actor said he'd be more than happy to reprise his role as the whip-carrying archaeologist for another film during an appearance on\n\n\"I would love to do another\n\nand work with Steven [Spielberg] again,\" Ford said. \"If we get a script, I'd love to do it.\"\n\nThe 73-year-old first portrayed Dr. Henry \"Indiana\" Jones in 1981, between the release of the second and third\n\nfilms.

If business leaders aren’t uber-transparent about why they believe their self-driving vehicles are safe, cautioned a law professor, the crucial element of public opinion won’t be on their side. And if we’re not realistic about human habits, predicted a Berkeley transportation expert, automated vehicles could lead us to waste more gas and cause more congestion instead of leading to a traffic and accident-free utopia on the road.\n\nThat Berkeley expert, professor Joan Walker, highlighted the example of “zero-occupancy” vehicles that could be clogging up residential streets as people summon them for on-demand home deliveries. One of the biggest problems in America’s transportation system is that the vast majority of trips are taken by people who are a driving an otherwise empty car, which sits dormant in their driveway 95% of the time. Many experts have touted the onset of self-driving cars is a chance to rethink that relationship and share fewer assets, easing traffic and lessening the need for parking spots. But Walker argued that people might also call for a self-driving car with all the environmental consideration they give to ordering their fifth package of the week on Amazon Prime.\n\n“To get to the future reality that we want will take not only automation,” said Walker, “but also requires behavior change.”\n\nConversations about self-driving cars have a tendency to drift into scintillating hypotheticals, whether someone is imagining just how many lives could be saved on the road if we took human error out of the equation or mulling the ethics of an autonomous sedan deciding whether to save the life of a rider or several pedestrians on a tram. But the speeches at the conference on Tuesday, which bills itself as “the largest gathering … of professionals involved with making automated vehicles a reality,” often concentrated on more mundane, more immediate ones.\n\nIs it ethical to beta test self-driving cars on the road when most of the people using that road haven’t given their consent? How much advertising will be allowed in a self-driving car or along the route that car is programmed to take? As more cars get semi-autonomous features—like self-parking or self-braking—who is going to take responsibility for explaining to drivers how they work? In the coming years, as those features become more robust, how do we train humans to stay engaged instead of literally going to sleep at the wheel?\n\nMany speakers pointed to the past and present to make arguments about how humans should be approaching the onset of self-driving cars, but with different aims. X’s head of policy, Sarah Hunter, argued that laws have tended to come after innovation in transportation, suggesting that too many lawmakers have been authoring statutes rather than offering up their states as “test beds.” Others pointed to our current relationship with private vehicles, with all its inefficiency, as a tale of how things could go wrong or lead to disparities in society. And others, particularly J.D. Power and Associates’ Kristin Kolodge, made the case that there isn’t enough attention being paid to the building blocks of autonomous cars that are live right now.\n\nKolodge presented research showing that drivers have resorted to “trial and error” in trying to figure out how to work features like adaptive cruise control (an increasingly common feature that uses sensors to keep the car at a set distance from the one in front of it, rather than at a set speed). Most of the people surveyed by J.D. Power said the dealer staff didn’t show them how such features worked. About half said their blind-spot monitors malfunctioned sometimes. Kolodge warned that the comfort and trust people have with these “assist” features will help determine how and when fully automated cars can “achieve serious volume.”\n\nTrust may have been top of mind for speakers in part because of the recent death of a Tesla driver; the role that autonomous technology may have played in the accident is under investigation by the federal government. Multiple speakers mentioned the incident, including Kolodge, as they emphasized how important the attitudes of human beings will be as new technology continues to roll out. “It’s extremely unfortunate the Tesla incident that happened,” she said. “This element of trust is extremely fragile.”\n\nAmong those who came to address the audience with a message of prudence was U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We don’t want to replace crashes with human factors with large numbers of crashes caused by systems,” Foxx said. But “ready or not,” he added, “autonomous vehicles are coming.”","Sunday, October 22th 2006, 2:33AM\n\n(Dates are subject to change)\n\nAt Boardwalk Hall (609) 348-7000\n\nOct. 27: The Stones roll out their \"Bigger Bang Tour\" for an 8 p.m. concert sponsored by the Borgata.

That is what Sheldon Harnick and Joseph Raposo are doing. They are working on a musical adaptati on of ''It's a WonderfulLife,'' Frank Capra's 1946 film that starred James Stewart as an amiable chap who is foiled in his attempt to break out of his smalltown life. Mr. Harnick is writing the bo ok and lyrics, and Mr. Raposo, the music. The producers are Mary Jo Slater and Eugene Wolsk.\n\nMr. Harnick, the lyricist for ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' reports that he and Mr. Raposo have been working on ''It's a Wonderful Life'' for nearly two years, but not solidly. ''In the midst of it,'' he says, ''I got an assignment from the Houston Grand Opera to do 'Carmen.' It opened last January. And Joe did the score for 'The Great Muppet Caper' movie.''\n\nMr. Harnick has also been working on another new musical, ''A Christmas Carol,'' which will open in Wilmington, Del., in November with Richard Kiley as Scrooge. After that, he and Mr. Raposo will give their full attention to ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' Theoretically, Mr. Harnick could have two shows on Broadway next season, for ''A Christmas Carol'' is scheduled to tour the country for a year and then open in New York.\n\n''You hate to rely on just one show,'' he observes. ''In this business, things tend to fall through.''\n\nBob Gunton, the original Juan Peron in ''Evita,'' is coming back to New York in Amlin Gray's ''How I Got That Story,'' which deals with the Vietnam War. Last season Mr. Gunton gave a tour de force performance in it, playing 21 different roles in an Off Off Broadway production at the Second Stage. Don Scardino will also be in the Obie award-winning play, which has a cast of two. Harold DeFelice and Louis Scheeder, the producers, plan to open ''How I Got That Story'' Off Broadway in early December. Carole Rothman, co-artistic director of the Second Stage, will again direct the play.\n\nMr. Scardino is now in previews with Jeffrey Moss's new musical ''Double Feature,'' due to open on Oct. 8 in the Theater at St. Peter's. But according to Miss Rothman, Mr. Scardino went into that show with the und erstanding that he could leave to do ''How I Got That Story.''\n\nJoseph Papp is giving David Henry Hwang the kind of support that most young playwrights don't even dream of. Mr. Papp produced Mr. Hwang's first play, ''F.O.B.'' Then, he produced his second, ''The Dance and the Railroad,'' which is still running at the Public Theater. Both plays received excellent reviews.\n\nAnd now he is producing Mr. Hwang's third play, ''Family Devotions,'' a comedy about a Chinese Communist who visits his rich relatives in the posh Bel Air section of Los Angeles. Robert Allan Ackerman is directing the production. Performances begin on Oct. 6.\n\nMr. Papp and Mr. Ackerman had trouble casting ''Family Devotions'' in New York and found seven of their nine actors in Los Angeles. ''There are not enough good Asian actors here,'' Mr. Papp says. ''Parts are not written for them. They have so little opportunity to act.''\n\nJill O'Hara says she is amazed by the timing of all this: She used to be a meek person who sat by herself and never opened her mouth at meetings of her tenants' association. Then, a year ago, she suddenly became the feisty ringleader of a hard-fought rent strike. And now, as the leader of a women's assertiveness training group in Barbara Schottenfeld's musical ''I Can't Keep Running in Place,'' Miss O'Hara is encouraging other women to stand up for themselves.\n\n''It's funny how my experience with the rent strike ties into the show,'' the 34-year-old Miss O'Hara says. ''The whole idea of fighting for your rights, and not being intimidated by the big boys. The first lawyers I talked to said we didn't have a case. Then I got the name of Leonard Lerner, a lawyer who specializes in tenants' rights. I call him the Legal Eagle. The landlord settled with us for $27,000 out of court. What I have learned from that experience!''\n\nMiss O'Hara went into ''I Can't Keep Running in Place'' at the Westside Arts Theater three weeks ago as Marcia Rodd's replacement. ''When I first heard about the role, I didn't think I'd like it,'' she says. ''I don't think the theater should be used to exploit political causes. So often you end up with a pamphlet on the stage instead of the human condition. But then I went to see the show, and was rocked by it. I didn't expect something that would move me so.''\n\nShe adds that she is surprised by the numbers of people who come up to her after the show to tell her how much they enjoyed her performance in the Neil Simon-Burt Bacharach musical ''Promises, Promises.'' That was in 1968, and Miss O'Hara was the toast of New York in her first - and only - starring role on Broadway. Previously she had been leading lady of the original production of ''Hair'' at the Public Theater.\n\n''I was only 21 in 'Promises,' '' Miss O'Hara says. ''People forget how young I was. I've done everything backward in my career.'' Since ''Promises,'' she has worked mostly in regional theaters and summer stock. ''I've done several Broadway-bound shows th at folded and didn't come in,'' she notes. ''There is a lot of luc k in this business. Actually, I hate show business, but I love my work. There are a lot of bad people in this business.\n\n''Did you know that the song 'I'll Never Fall in Love Again' from 'Promises' was written for me? Burt Bacharach wanted to record it with me. My manager said no. I didn't know at the time that my manager was starting his own record company and wanted me to record the song for him. Eventually, he went bankrupt. Dionne Warwick recorded the song. I have a few other stories like that, unfortunately.''\n\nSuddenly, Miss O'Hara's frown turns into a big smile. ''I have a very rich personal life,'' she reports. ''I'm engaged to Philip Jones, a painter, and I've never been happier.'\n\nTonight ''Evita'' begins its third year at the Broadway Theater. The cast is currently headed by Derin Altay as Eva Peron, James Stein as Che Guevera and David Cryer as Juan Peron. ... Casting notes from the Manhattan Theater Club: Cleavon Little will make a rare New York stage appearance as the star of Oyama's new play, ''The Resurrection of Lady Lester.'' He will portray Lester Young, the jazz saxophonist. And Alvin Epstein has been signed to star in Alonso Alegria's new play ''Crossing Niagara.'' Both productions begin performances on Oct. 20. ... Christopher Durang's one-act comedies, ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You'' and ''The Actor's Nightmare,'' will open on Oct. 22 at Playwrights Horizons. Elizabeth Franz, Polly Draper, Robert Joy, Timothy Landfield, Mark Stefan and Mary Catherine Wright will head the casts, and Jerry Zaks will direct. ...

Credit experts say that only time, effort and a solid plan for repaying your debts will improve your credit-worthiness.\n\nThere are plenty of unsavory operators out there, so be careful. Many consumers have lost hundreds if not thousands of dollars to scammers who take their money and do nothing to improve their credit. Here are some warning signs, according to the Federal Trade Commission:\n\nThe company wants you to pay up front for credit repair service before they do any work.\n\nThey do not disclose your legal rights.\n\nThey recommend that you don't contact the credit bureau directly.\n\nThey advise you to take action that seems illegal, such as creating a new credit identity or disputing all the information in your credit report, even info that is correct. (You can be charged with mail or wire fraud if you apply for credit and give false information.)\n\nUnder the federal Credit Repair Organizations Act, credit repair companies need to provide a detailed written contract about the services they'll perform, include a three-day right to cancel without charge, state how long it will take to see results, disclose the total cost to you and outline any guarantees. It's illegal for them to charge you up front.\n\nBefore you hire anyone, remember this: The sad truth is that accurate negative information stays on your report for seven years. Bankruptcies are reported for 10 years. Criminal info can stay on forever.\n\nNo credit repair company can get rid of that.\n\nIf there's incorrect information on your report, however, that's another story – and you can fix that yourself. All consumers are entitled to a free copy of their reports with the three major credit reporting bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) every 12 months at www.annualcreditreport.com. And if you've been denied credit, insurance or employment due to a lousy credit report within the last 30 days, you also are entitled to a free copy of your report.\n\nLook for mistakes or outdated items. You can dispute these for free through the credit reporting bureaus. Explain why you're disputing it, provide copies of documents and request an investigation. Tip: Include a copy of the credit report with the questionable items circled. Send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. The credit reporting bureau must investigate within 30 days. You also should contact the company that provided the inaccurate information so they can correct it.\n\nIf you win your dispute, the credit reporting bureau will have to correct your report. You may also request that they send the corrected version to anyone who received your report in the past six months (or two years for reports that went to prospective employers).\n\nIf you don't win, you can ask that your report includes a statement with your version of the dispute.\n\nWhatever the state of your credit report, don't lose heart. Some creditors are willing to look at your more recent credit history, so as long as you keep showing improvement, a past problem might not set you back. If you're still struggling, consider using a non-profit credit counseling service to get back on track. If you go this route, ask your local consumer agency, financial institution, military base or other trusted source for a recommendation, or check out the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, www.nfcc.org, the country's largest non-profit credit counseling service, with 90 member agencies nationwide.\n\n(Sources: Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Illinois Attorney General, Experian)\n\nClick Here for the ABC News Fixer Homepage.","So sayeth Padre general manager Kevin Towers.\n\nLess than two weeks after unofficially setting his starting rotation by trading for No. 1 Kevin Brown and re-signing No. 5 Pete Smith, Towers stirred the pot Jan. 7 by signing Mark Langston to a minor league contract.\n\nBut the Padres have no intention of having Langston pitch at Triple-A Las Vegas. And neither does the 37-year-old left-hander.\n\n\"We didn't get him to pitch at Las Vegas,\" said GM Kevin Towers emphatically. \"If Mark is back to full health, he's going to go for one of the spots in the starting rotation.\"\n\nThere's the rub. Langston had elbow and knee problems last year and made only one start (Aug. 20) after undergoing arthroscopic surgery in May to have bone spurs removed from his left elbow.\n\nIt was his second round of elbow surgery in four seasons.\n\nHowever, the Padres hit the jackpot once before with a over-the-hill left-hander. Fernando Valenzuela was 13-8 with a 3.62 ERA in '96 and helped pitch the Padres to the N.L. West title.\n\nLangston thinks it will. And Towers said it's not that big a gamble.\n\n\"Right now, we're very happy with the rotation we have,\" said Towers of the Brown, Andy Ashby, Joey Hamilton, Sterling Hitchcock and Smith quintet.\n\n\"But you never know about pitching. Something can happen and usually does. I like insurance.\"\n\nLangston has a career 174-150 record with a 3.88 ERA. He is a four-time All-Star and was Anaheim's opening day starter last April.\n\nAnd a year after his 1994 surgery, Langston bounced back with a 15-7 record with a 4.63 ERA.\n\nLangston said his arm is sound and said he shouldn't have tried to return last year.\n\n\"I simply tried to come back too soon last year,\" he said. \"The Angels were in a pennant race and short on starting pitchers. So I tried to help out and it was a mistake. I was advised by the doctors not to do it.\n\n\"But the arm feels good. I've been playing long toss for a month with no problems. I see myself winning one of those starting spots in San Diego. And I believe we have the makings of being a contender. If I'm healthy, I will enhance this team.\"\n\nThe Angels did not offer Langston a contract after last season (2-4, 5.65 ERA). Langston said he had better offers elsewhere, but chose to remain as close as possible to his Anaheim Hills home in Southern California.\n\n\"I see no downside to signing Mark,\" said Padre manager Bruce Bochy. \"It's definitely worth taking a look for us. He certainly knows how to pitch.\"\n\nTowers said the addition of Brown and Langston might also help Ashby and Hamilton mature into better pitchers.\n\n\"We've now got three guys here (Brown, Langston and pitching coach Dave Stewart) who have pitched at the highest levels of competition. I think it will do a world of good for our other pitchers to watch how these guys go about their business.\"\n\nLangston has played only one season in the N.L., going 12-9 with a 2.38 in Montreal over two-thirds of the '89 season.\n\nNOTES, QUOTES, ANECDOTES The Padres signed 2B/leadoff man Quilvio Veras to a two-year contract worth $3.1 million. Veras, who turns 27 April 3, will make $1.1 million this season and $2 in 1998. The switch-hitter struggled early last year while sharing the leadoff job with Rickey Henderson, but batted .293 over the last 100 games. But he needs to reduce his 84 strikeouts, draw more than 72 walks and hit better than .194 from the right side.\n\nIt's official. Native San Diegan 1B Eddie Williams is back for a third fling as a Padre, although Williams will be playing in Las Vegas as an insurance policy against Wally Joyner being hurt. Williams, who signed a minor league contract, hit .240 with three homers and 12 RBI in 38 games with the Dodgers and Pirates last season.\n\nPut Greg Vaughn ahead of Ruben Rivera in the Padre left field derby. Rivera has been hovering around .200 in the Dominican Republic Winter League after missing much of the campaign with a broken finger. Over the last year, Rivera has had less than 100 at bats. \"I don't care what he hits, but Ruben needed more swings,\" said Towers.\n\nROSTER REPORT FREE AGENCY UPDATE -- Signed catcher Greg Myers (Braves), catcher Carlos Hernandez (re-signed), signed infielder Craig Shipley (allowed to become free-agent), right-handed pitcher Pete Smith (re-signed), left-handed pitcher Mark Langston (Angels, signed to minor-league contract).\n\nMEDICAL WATCH -- Left fielder Greg Vaughn (recovering from right knee surgery), third baseman Ken Caminiti (recovering from right knee surgery), first baseman Wally Joyner (recovering from right knee surgery), center fielder Steve Finley (recovering from big toe surgery), right fielder Tony Gwynn (recovering from left knee surgery), outfielder Ruben Rivera (recovering from a broken left finger).","In one fell swoop, Varanasi belonged to Narendra Modi, the right-wing leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and soon-to-be India’s prime minister.\n\nVaranasi, a Hindu temple town but a BJP stronghold for decades, went out of its way this time to vote for Modi, who secured a whopping 5,165,93 votes, defeating his nearest rival, Arvind Kejriwal—chief of the fairly new but fast-rising, anti-graft Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)—by more than 300,000 votes.\n\nIn 2009, BJP candidate and senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi—a sitting Member of Parliament from Varanasi who Modi had sidestepped to contest the prestigious seat himself creating a short lived flutter of dissent within the party—had won by what now appears to be a meager 17,000 votes.\n\nEven as votes from the world’s largest election were being counted on Friday morning, Varanasi was full of posters congratulating Modi of a “historic win.” BJP workers were seen milling around in small clusters, decked up in saffron t-shirts and stoles, at the Paharia Sabzi Mandi on the outskirts of the city, where counting of votes was in progress.\n\nAnticipation hung heavy in the air, broken momentarily by shouts of “Har Har Modi” (a take on “Har Har Mahadev” a popular Hindu slogan praising Lord Shiva that had earlier angered the people of Varanasi) slogans at the beat of drums.\n\nThe ubiquitous young supporters in dark glasses and saffron clothes zoomed around in motorbikes. LED screens blared out televised coverage of the counting of results at important intersections in the city.\n\nAlthough the Indian media started reporting in the afternoon that Modi had won (possibly looking at the margin of votes with which he was leading), the final results came in only in the evening, when BJP supporters erupted in euphoric chants and slogans that later spilled over into fireworks and colors.\n\nThey smeared each other with saffron and green colors, distributed sweets and took out small victory processions. But in general, celebrations were muffled, as election Commission officials had banned victory processions in Varanasi (and throughout Uttar Pradesh, which has seen major communal riots in the recent past) after results were announced.\n\nAAP’s Kejriwal, who reached Varanasi on Friday morning, was stoic about his defeat.\n\n“It’s the people’s verdict,” he told TIME. “We have to accept it.”\n\nFor a new party and with much less financial clout than the BJP, the Kejriwal-led AAP had undoubtedly put up a laudable fight against the indomitable Modi wave that had engulfed most of India in elections 2014. Kejriwal had walked away with 1,79,739 of the votes, relegating the Congress party’s Ajay Rai, local strongman, to the third position.\n\n“Tough luck for AAP. We keep talking about change but when it comes to bringing it in, we shy away,” says Aloke Thakur, a small trader, looking disappointed as the results were announced.\n\nModi is expected to be in Varanasi on Saturday evening to celebrate his and his party’s win with a Ganga Aaarti—an invocation of the river Ganges—a grand evening ritual that attracts people from all over the world to the shores of the river Ganges in Varanasi.\n\n“We are happy Modi won, he has said he will transform Varanasi in one year,” says Dipu Majhi, a first time voter, who voted for the BJP. “Let’s see what he does.”\n\nGolu Sahni, another first time voter says, “If not, then we can always change our mind after five years.”","FORTUNE — A harried commuter riding home on the bus uses his smartphone to buy last-minute holiday toys for his kids. An office worker sitting outside during lunch browses fashion sites on her phone and buys the latest Ugg boots before returning to her desk. Online retailing executives describe scenes like these — people shopping on the go — when touting mobile commerce and its potential. The reality is far different, however.\n\nMobile shopping is largely done on tablets, and not smartphones. Moreover, the term mobile shopping is somewhat of a misnomer. Yes, people use mobile devices to window shop. But much of the buying is done at home from the living room sofa, and not from a park bench, subway or the sidelines of a children’s soccer game, according to analysts. “The smartphone is actually a terrible device to complete a transaction on,” says Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst for Forrester FORR , the technology consulting company. “There’s no question that the tablet is easier.”\n\nLast year, tablets accounted for 3.2% of all U.S. online retail sales, more than double the 1.5% share for smartphones, according to a survey of 55 online retailers by Forrester. The reasons for the gap boil down to this: Smartphone screens are so tiny that browsing products online and entering credit card information is a pain.\n\nMORE: 11 worst predictions of 2012\n\nOf course, compared to overall e-commerce, mobile shopping is miniscule. But it is growing quickly and is expected to account for a far greater share of online retailing in the coming years. Mobile shopping represented 10% of e-commerce in the quarter ending in September, according to comScore SCOR . On certain days, like Black Friday, the shopping-crazy day following Thanksgiving, mobile devices accounted for 16% of all sales, IBM IBM said.\n\nCompanies like eBay EBAY consider mobile shopping to be critical to their futures. John Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, predicts that shoppers using mobile devices will spend $10 billion on his site this year, double the amount in 2011.\n\nDespite the high expectations, retailers are still grappling with how to deal with the shift in consumer behavior. The field is so nascent that it’s difficult for companies to know what to do or how to measure success. Experimentation is common. Spending a lot of money can be hard to justify in the short-term, however, because of the limited sales generated.\n\nAt eBags, an online retailer in Denver, tablets accounted for 10.8% of overall traffic in the latest quarter and around 10.4% of sales. Meanwhile, smartphones represented 8.4% of overall traffic, but only 2.9% of sales. Peter Cobb, chief executive for eBags, explained that tablet users behave much like people on desktop computers or laptops. Shoppers on tablets meander around retail sites, watch product videos and buy what they want – all while sipping wine in front of the television.\n\nMORE: Apple’s App Store vs. Google Play: Where they stand\n\nSmartphone users, in contrast, are more pressed for time and on a “search and destroy” mission, as Cobb put it. People want to get in, compare prices and get out until they go home and complete a purchase using their home computer, so to avoid any hassles in the check out process. “The reality is that there are two different shopping experiences,” Cobb says.\n\nThe greater success in getting tablet users to buy comes despite a big disadvantage in numbers. There are around 137 million smartphones in the United States compared with only 61 million tablets, according to Forrester. The relative numbers show just how little sales smartphones drive, at least directly. Average order sizes on smartphones are also smaller at $134.37 versus $159.28 for tablets.\n\nStill, smartphones play an important role for retailers. People use them to research products before making purchases from home. Additionally, many shoppers do so before visiting a bricks and mortar store. Comparing prices inside stores and scanning QR codes is also common.\n\nSuch behavior, known as showrooming, is a sore point with some retail executives, who complain about shoppers eyeballing products in their stores that they intend to buy from online rivals. Nordstrom’s JWN , Target TGT and Saks Fifth Avenue SKS have taken an opposite approach by installing Wi-Fi in their stores to help customers connect online through their smartphones.\n\nMORE: Amazon: TV is about to get way more interesting\n\nIgnoring the fact that customers are using smartphones in stores is futile, the theory goes. In any case, smartphones can potentially drive more business if retailers use it to their advantage. A study this year by Deloitte Consulting, for example, that found that mobile phones influence 5.1% of all in-store retail sales, or around $159 billion in transactions. That amount far exceeds the $12 billion consumers will spend via direct mobile shopping, the study said.\n\nCobb, from eBags, says that he plans to make a number of adjustments to his mobile site over the next year to make it more appealing to shoppers using smartphones. By then, he’ll have a better idea of what to highlight by tracking the products that shoppers click on a lot versus the “dead spots” that get relatively few clicks. Expect bigger buttons, he said, so that customers can more easily use their smartphone screen to navigate. Letting customers search by brands is another key feature because smartphone users generally knowing what they want.\n\n“I do believe it is our job to unlock the potential of smartphones because it’s only going to keep growing,” Cobb says.","updated 03/05/2015 AT 11:15 AM EST\n\n•originally published 03/05/2015 AT 09:00 AM EST\n\nIn a season full of songs both catchy (\"\n\njust aired what many fans consider its best song yet.\n\nBut don't just take our word for it – as of this writing, the song has hit #4 on the\n\nNot just a good jam for a TV show cranking them out week after week, \"Conquerer,\" as performed by Jussie Smollett and British singer-songwriter Estelle, is a legitimately beautiful duet that will be stuck in your head all week.\n\nThe melody is as soaring as its lyrics (\"I'd rather stand tall / Than live on my knees, / 'Cause I am a conqueror, / And I won't accept defeat\") and Estelle's voice is perfectly matched to Smollett's, whose gorgeous vocals are sometimes drowned out by overproduction.\n\nIn Wednesday's episode, \"Unto the Breach,\" Jamal (Smollett) managed to sign Delfine (Estelle) to Empire Entertainment despite Lucious's (\n\n) initial misgivings about his son's desire to take on a more businesslike role within the family company.\n\nSo, we can only hope for more duets from these two in the future, because\n\njust knocked it out of the park and set a near-impossible standard with three episodes left in a season that has shattered ratings records week after week.

analytics and news to more than 300,000 professional market participants around the world.\n","\n","Many traders and investors rely on its messaging service for their main communications and even to execute trades between each other. These customers pay about $20,000 annually for the service.\n","\n","Other than messaging, the top \"functions\" on the Bloomberg are top news stories, stock charts, and bond price analytics. There is also formal trading execution product called \"Bloomberg Tradebook.\"\n","\n","This is why an outage on April 17 actually affected market volume and caused the U.K. to postpone a debt auction. Without the messaging and data the company provides, investors didn't have the communication means or the information they typically rely on to execute trades, especially for those involved in the bond markets.\n","\n","While it is known in Wall Street circles as \"The Bloomberg Terminal\" the company has worked over the years to change that nickname and use its official name \"The Bloomberg Professional Service.\" This is because in the 1990's the company transitioned from a physcial terminal in offices to making it a piece of software accessible from anywhere. Traders can now even access their terminal on their smart phones using the \"Bloomberg Anywhere\" service.\n","\n","Former New York City Mayor and Billionaire Michael Bloomberg founded the parent company Bloomberg L.P. in 1981 after taking a $10 million severance payment from Salomon Brothers. The service began as a groundbreaking trade data provider for so-called buyside investors, when at the time,the \"sell-side\"—made up mostly of investment banks—held the information edge. \n"," What
